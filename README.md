# scgpico

The repo hosts the content of the [Software Composition Group](http://scg.unibe.ch) web site. The web site has been migrated from a legacy [Pier CMS](https://www.piercms.com) to a markdown-based [Pico CMS](https://picocms.org).

The markdown files can be found in the [content](./content) folder. Pico configuration files are in PicoConfig.
