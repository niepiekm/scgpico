# SCG Pico web site

The repo hosts the content of the [Software Composition Group](http://scg.unibe.ch) web site. The web site has been migrated from a legacy [Pier CMS](https://www.piercms.com) to a markdown-based [Pico CMS](https://picocms.org).

The markdown files can be found in the [content](content) folder. Pico configuration files are in [PicoConfig](PicoConfig).

**NB:** The downloads are not stored in this repo, but directly [on the server](http://scg.unibe.ch/assets/).

There is a separate repository for the [SCG bibliography](https://github.com/scgbern/scgbib).
