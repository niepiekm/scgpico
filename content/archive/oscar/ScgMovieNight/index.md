[Singin' in the Rain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singin'_in_the_Rain) (1952) is at once a great musical, and very funny and clever comedy, and a commentary on the transition from slient to sound movies.
Even if you don't like musicals, you will certainly find much to enjoy here, and if you do like musicals, this is one of the greatest ones of all time!
