#How to get to our house

By now I assume you have made it to the train crossing in the centre of Kehrsatz, right next to the train station. 

##On foot
Follow the *red* path on the map.

- Cross the train tracks and walk up *Zimmerwaldstrasse*.
- After about 100 m, turn right at *Weidliweg* and walk to the end of the street.
- Here you will find a footpath going up the side of the hill. Walk to the top.
- Now you are in Fluhmattweg. Turn right and go to our house (number 41).
*Warning:* there are a large number of steps about halfway up the footpath. If you are pushing a pram or a bicycle, you might prefer to follow the road instead.

##By car
Follow the *blue* path on the map.

- Cross the train tracks and drive up *Zimmerwaldstrasse*.
- After about 400 m, there is a small glass architects' office and a big sign that says *BREITÃGERTEN*. It is sooner than you might expect! Turn right into *Talstrasse*.
- After another 300 m, turn right into *Gurtenstrasse*.
- After 400 m, turn right into *Fluhmattweg*. Continue until you reach the *Besucherparkplatz*. Leave your car there. Our house is the second on your left after the visitors' parking lot (number 41).
