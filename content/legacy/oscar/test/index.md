How do I list the contents of the subpages, instead of just the links?

```+>value:children|link|select=Page+
```
- [2009-06-06](test/2009-06-06)
- [2009-06-09](test/2009-06-09)


```+>value:contents|link|select=Page|embed=true+
```


```+>value:children+
```
- [2009-06-06](test/2009-06-06)
- [2009-06-09](test/2009-06-09)


```+>value:contents+
```
