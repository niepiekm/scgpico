#General
Please use lowercase characters to name pages and files. This is what you get asked for when creating a new structure or when moving one. The name of a structure is independent of the title and is used to refer to the page and to build the URL.

#Uploads

-  Embedded files such as images are uploaded through Pier. Add a new structure of type File and upload the file through the web-browser.
-  PDF documents should go to the archive folder on haddock.unibe.ch:/srv/scg.unibe.ch/web/archive, refer to them using an URL like [/archive](%assets_url%/archive).
-  Downloads should go to the download folder on haddock.unibe.ch:/srv/scg.unibe.ch/web/download, refer to them using an URL like [/download](%assets_url%/download).

#News

-  Go to [SCG News](%base_url%/news) and select *add* to add a new post.
-  Give the post a title, a publication timestamp (press current) and the contents.

#User management
To add a new user **log in as administrator** (scg). Go to [Users](%base_url%/system/management/users), type the username and click add. Fill the other information and assign the group. We have 3 main groups of users:


| | |
|---|---|
|! Group  |! Description
| staff   | reserved for the scg staff and it covers all pages except for the wiki ones and of the private ones
| wiki    | covers the [/wiki](%base_url%/wiki) pages
| private | is left empty and it covers all the pages that should only be accessed by a single user (e.g., those below [/staff](%base_url%/staff))


-  Staff members should get the groups *staff* and *wiki* (in that order).
-  Students usually only get the group *wiki*.
