I have finished my bachelor's thesis on visually mining scientific communities at the SCG in September 2017.

This semester (autumn 2017) I'm doing a master's seminar project at this group. The goal of the project is to implement a command line interface for the BibTeX reference manager [JabRef](http://www.jabref.org/). The project is supervised by [Claudio Corrodi](%base_url%/staff/Corrodi).
