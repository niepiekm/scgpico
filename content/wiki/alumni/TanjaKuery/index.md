I am a bachelors students at university of Bern, with major in computer science and minors in biology and sustainable development. I am just starting with my bachelors thesis concerning one database of zemis (zentrales Einwohner-Migrationssystem), namely the one containing "static" data that is used for different purposes and does not change often (e.g. like states, towns,...)

For the last three years I have been working for the State Secretary for Migration (SEM) as a functionality tester for zemis and its interfaces for about 16 hours a week.
