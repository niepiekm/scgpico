As a Bachelor Student I'm currently writing my thesis on the topic of finding and mitigating cross-site scripting attack vectors by using web application security scanners. In the aforementioned paper I'm comparing different OpenSource and Freeware web crawlers in various criteria like profundity, useability and installation effort needed
The thesis also contains different variants of how to mitigate attack vectors which stem from improper neutralization of input fields.
