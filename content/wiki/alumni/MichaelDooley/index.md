I am a Bachelor student currently working on my Bachelor's thesis - [Comparison of commenting conventions covered by style guidelines and tools](http://scg.unibe.ch/wiki/projects/mastersbachelorsprojects/Commenting-conventions-in-style-guidelines-style-checkers). This project mainly revolves around how linters implement class comment guidelines.
