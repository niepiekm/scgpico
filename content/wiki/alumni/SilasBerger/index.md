I have finished my bachelor's thesis on visually mining scientific communities at the SCG in September 2017.

This semester (autumn 2017) Iâm doing a masterâs seminar project at this group. The goal of the project is to implement a command line interface for the BibTeX reference manager [JabRef](http://www.jabref.org/). The project is supervised by [Claudio Corrodi](http://scg.unibe.ch/staff/Corrodi).
