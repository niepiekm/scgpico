I am a bachelor student at the University of Bern and am currently working on my bachelor project under the supervision of Dr. Mohammad Ghafari.

The project concerns code review in the area of security vulnerabilities in Android apps, and is linked with other projects concerning security vulnerabilities. I will review the symptoms highlighted by a plugin in AndroidStudio in apps and assess if they actually match against possible vulnerabilities. In the end, the goal is to build a ground truth for various kinds of vulnerabilities in mobile apps which will help to assess the security analysis tools made by the SC group.
