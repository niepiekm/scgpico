Hei

I am studying computer science  at the University of Bern and working on my bachelor thesis, which I am enjoying a lot.

In my project I am involved in a Language software Zeeguu that should make everyone's life easier to learn a new language.

My job is to analyze the data of the user of this application and give them a feedback, so that they can see if they have made some progress.

It is a project where you are working very closely with MYSQL and using the programming language python.

Feel free to contact me, if you have any questions.

Cheers
Karan
