Hello

I'm working on my bachelors Thesis [Actionable Software Visualization](%base_url%/wiki/projects/mastersbachelorsprojects/obsolete/Actionable-Software-Visualization), guided by Leonel Merino. 

The goal is to recommend developers suitable visualizations for their questions that arise during the development process. This tool will be integrated in Eclipse.

The project consists of the following steps:

- Grab questions to developer needs
- Propose visualizations to the questions
- Process Data
- Collect d3-example visualizations of developer questions
- Find and/or make a d3 implementation
- Design and implement an executable tool in Eclipse
