I am currently finishing up my bachelor's degree in computer science at the Software Composition Group of the University of Bern.

My bachelor's thesis is called [Adding Class Support and Global Methods to Polite Smalltalk](/archive/projects/Stei16a.pdf). [Polite](/research/Polite) is a programming language introduced by [Mircea Lungu](/staff/mircea) and [Jan Kur≈°](/staff/kursjan) in 2013. It is very similar to [Pharo Smalltalk](http://pharo.org/) but allows so called sentence identifiers, allowing for code that looks more similar to everyday language in order to improve code readability and maintainability.

My main tasks in working with Polite are related to parsing, visitors & ASTs and compilers.

The validation code for the thesis can be downloaded as a moose [image](/wiki/students/ThomasSteinmann/validation?view=PRDownloadView) for Pharo 4.
