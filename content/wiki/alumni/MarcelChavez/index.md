Hi everybody. I'm currently working on my bachelor thesis supervised by Prof. Dr. O. Nierstrasz.

In collaboration with the company I'm currently working at my goal is to develop an archive system for long term storing. Because the archive is an important part of a company there are some restrictions given from the government. So I'm really excited to go forward in this project and face all incoming challenges.
