Developers have a lot of questions and they try to find answers on different social media and community-driven sites (e.g. [developers questions](https://www.stackoverflow.com)). This data is very precious for researchers and often used in various studies.

I'm interested in finding out where developers post their questions and how researchers analyze this data. I'm working on my master thesis "Investigating developer questions on social media".
