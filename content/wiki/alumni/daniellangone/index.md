The aim of my Master thesis is to provide a unifying model of subjectivity based on perspectives, roles, COP and Subjective Message Behavior. Te resulting framework is called [Subjectopia](http://scg.unibe.ch/research/subjectopia).


My Bachelor thesis aimed a language independent tool to bind Ecplise ASTs to FAMIX Models.
