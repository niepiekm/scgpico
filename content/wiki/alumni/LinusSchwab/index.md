Title: Linus Schwab
---

Hey there,

My name is Linus Schwab, I'm studying computer science at the University of Bern and I'm currently working on my bachelor project.

The project for my bachelor thesis is to develop an RSS reader for Android with 
[Zeeguu](https://www.zeeguu.unibe.ch/) integration. Some of the planned features of the app are an intelligent article recommender, which will select the news articles that match best to the current language level of the user, and of course it will be possible to directly translate unknown words while reading and save them in the word list for later. I will use the [Feedly API](https://developer.feedly.com/) for the RSS part of the app.
