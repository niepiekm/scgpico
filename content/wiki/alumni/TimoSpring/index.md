#Timo Spring
Hello. 
My name is Timo Spring and I am a bachelor student at the SCG of the University of Bern. I am currently working on my bachelor thesis project about "Benchmarking Android Security Analyses". The project is supervised by Claudio Corrodi.

There are millions of apps available in virtual stores, with thousands more added on a daily basis. Thus, the chance of security related bugs finding their way to the end user increases. While a lot of research effort has been done in specifying large scale taxonomies and artifacts, there is a lack of evidence comparing individual approaches in one particular application against each other. 

The goal of this project is to apply and compare different analysis approaches for a suitable domain on a common dataset. This should allow us to draw conclusions about their implementation's quality of results and overall performance.
