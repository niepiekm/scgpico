Hello, I'm Mario Kaufmann and I'm a master student at SCG in Bern. Currently, I am working on my master project.

The project is supervised by Andrei ChiÈ. We are creating a new possible way to interact with the Inspector in the Pharo programming environment.

Interacting with an object in the Pharo inspector produces a series of steps that are applied in order to go from the source object to the final, desired result. Currently, it is not possible to perform these operations other than by hand.

The goal of this project is to add the possibility to record an interaction with an object through the inspector and to replay that interaction on another object. This should enable an user to reuse certain steps instead of repeating them by hand multiple times.
