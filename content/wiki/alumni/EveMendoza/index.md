#Bachelor Thesis: Visualizing Objects in Pharo

I am a bachelor student currently working on my bachelor's thesis under the supervision of Claudio Corrodi. 

My Bachelor thesis is on the topic of Visualization of objects in Pharo. The aim is to create a flexible framework which allows us to inspect a set of objects. The visualisation gives a graphic representation of the references between the different objects, showing how different objects are connected and interact with each other.
By implementing persisting subgraphs across different renderings we want to ease code understanding and ease debugging. 
Additionally customisable node shapes should be made possible so that the programmers can implement different individual shapes for different objects allowing them to make the visualisation more comprehensible.
