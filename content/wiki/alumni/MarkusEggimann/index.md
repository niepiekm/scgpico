Title: Markus Eggimann
---

Hi, my name is Markus Eggimann. I'm a bachelor student in computer science at the SCG at the university of Bern.

I'm currently working on my bachelor project about software testing. The project is supervised by Mohammad Ghafari. We focus on some industrial software projects and try to find out, how software bugs and software tests are related during the project lifetime. We want to find out whether the presence of tests helps to find bugs or whether discovered bugs push the writing of test cases.

Beside my studies at the university, I work for the Swiss Post as a software developer since 2013. I develop web applications for different customers within the company.
