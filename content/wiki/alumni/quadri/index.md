##Language Boxes

**Goal:** not to be restrictet to one DSL while not loosing the development tools.

Host and context specific language

polyglot = Mehrsprachig


---

##Dynamic Adaptation
###Language Constructs for Contextoriented Programming

**Goal:** Avoid having to spread contextdependent behavior throughout a program

Layers for partial class and methods

root layer

each layer has a name

dynamically scoped layer activation obeys a stack-like discipline


---

##Meta-Objects
###Mirrors: Design Principles for Meta-level Facilities of Object-Oriented Programming Languages


**Goal:** Meta-level functionality should be implemented separately from base-level functionality, using objects known as mirrors

Design principles for meta-level facilities in object oriented programming languages:

- Encapsulation. Meta-level facilities must encapsulate their implementation.
- Stratification. Meta-level facilities must be separated from base-level functionality
- Ontological Correspondence. The ontology of metalevel facilities should correspond to the ontology of the language they manipulate.

##Subjectivity
###Subjective Behavior: a General Dynamic Method Dispatch

- Subjectivity
- multi-methods
- context awareness
- method dispatching
- reflection.

Benefit: Dynamic Interface Adaptatio, Dynamic Message Visibility and Dynamic Decision Learning:

# Other literature

##The Paradigms of Programming
**Goal:** methodological abstraction


- structured programming
- dynamic programming
- recursive coroutines

"If the advancement of the general art of programming
requires the continuing invention and elaboration of
paradigms, advancement of the art of the individual
programmer requires that he expand his repertory of
paradigms."
