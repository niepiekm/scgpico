I'm a BSc student working on phishing and its automation.

During my thesis, I will explore techniques for creating phished web sites on demand with the least possible anomalies noticeable by victims.
The goal of this project is to better understand the threat that arises from dynamic phishing which will foster future remedies against such attacks.
