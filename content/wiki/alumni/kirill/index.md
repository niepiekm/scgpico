I am a PhD Candidate at the University of Bern in the Software Composition Group. Prior to this, I got my degree in Mathematics and Computer Science under the supervision of Prof. Dr. H.-J. Bartels, with the thesis Contributions to the Longevity Risk in Life Insurance" and in Management Information Systems under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Stefan Minner, with the thesis Optimal solution and heuristics for dual-supply inventory models“ at the [University of Mannheim](http://www.uni-mannheim.de) (Germany) in 2010.<br />
Apart from being a PhD student at the University of Bern, I work in the area of Software Engineering in different projects. Currently I am working for a project of the Swiss Federal Railways (SBB CFF FFS).
