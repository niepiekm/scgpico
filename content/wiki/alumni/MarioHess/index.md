Hi!
My name is Mario Hess and I'm a bachelor student at the University of Bern. Currently I'm writing my bachelor thesis in the SCG. 

My [project](/wiki/projects/mastersbachelorsprojects/pervasive-visualization-in-ar-for-software-monitoring) is supervised by Leonel Merino. Together we are evaluating the potential of monitoring a software in augmented reality.  

Live software monitorization (e.g. for memory usage) is traditionally performed through an interface on the computer screen. Consistently paying attention to that interface, reduces your capability to do other tasks. 

We think that an interface in augment reality allows you to perform other tasks, while still being able to pay attention to the monitorization.
