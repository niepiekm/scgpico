I am a bachelor student in Computer Science with minor in Mathematics and English. My Bachelor thesis [Categorizing Testing Smells](%base_url%/wiki/projects/Categorizing-Test-Smells) is about good and bad practices in writing tests. It deals with questions like: 

What 'smells' in a test code?
How can test smells be avoided or fixed?
How important is it to be concerned about test smells when writing tests?
