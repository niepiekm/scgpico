ESUG 2006 Hacks with PMM, MM

-  SqueakMap loading (http://mc.lukas-renggli.ch/sm/)
	-  using OSProcesses, simpler without the caching stuff, finally works

-  Monticello (http://mc.lukas-renggli.ch/sm/)
	-  feedback
	-  merged with latest versions (excluding pwd stuff)

-  Monticello Configuration (http://mc.lukas-renggli.ch/sm/)
	-  same look as MC
	-  postscript actions
	-  inspecting feedback after save/load, more feedback added
	-  compatible to older versions

-  Omnibrowser (http://www.squeaksource.com/OBAddOns)
	-  chasing references instead of "plain" list
