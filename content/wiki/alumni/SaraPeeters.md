I am a bachelor Student in computer science at the University of Bern. In the second half of 2017 I will be doing my Bachelors project in the SCG group. The idea is to create a webapp to help autistic people communicate about their autism diagnosis and the accomodations they need. For this project I will be working with the Psychiatrische Dienste Interlaken as well as with autistic adults and parents of autistic kids. A full project description can be found here.
