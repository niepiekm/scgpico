#Max Leske
I am a master student with the SCG group, interested in remote debugging techniques. I work with [Pharo](http://pharo.org) and the remote communications framework [Seamless](http://smalltalkhub.com/#!/~Pharo/Seamless) to enable developers to debug asynchronous remote processes in the context of the original local process. Pharo is particularly well suited for this because (almost) every structure has a reification and can be treated as a first class object. Therefore, processes and method activations can be interacted with without requiring modification of the virtual machine.

In 2011 I completed my [Bachelor's project](/archive/projects/Lesk11a.pdf) entitled "The Genesis of Pharo: The Complete History of Pharo with Git", also written at the SCG group.
