Hi

My name is Sébastien Broggi. I am a Computer Science (Bachelor) student and I started with my bachelor's thesis in November 2016.

My Bachelor thesis will be about Bug Prediction with AI (Classify Bugs \+ Predict fixes). I will be working with Haidar Osman for that.
The goal of this project will be to detect bugs and suggest Bugfixes autonomously using Neural Networks / Deep Learning. This project will be implemented using the Java Library "DL4J".


More information and the current code of the project can be found on <a href="https://github.com/broggi/DL4J-Bugprediction">GitHub (DL4J-Bugprediction)</a>
