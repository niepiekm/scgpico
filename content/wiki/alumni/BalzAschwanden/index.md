Title: Balz Aschwanden
---

Hi SCG,

I'm a bachelor student (major: computer science, minor: sociology) at Bern and I'm working on my bachelor thesis **Contextual Annotations on Dynamic Content**.

When I'm not studying, I work as a system administrator for Mac OS X in Basel.

If you are interested in my other projects, you can find most of what I've done at Bern on <a href="https://github.com/aschwanb">GitHub</a>. Maybe the bachelor thesis will go there too.
