Bachelor Thesis: Writing a Shape Grammar Editor

I am a bachelor student working on creating a shape grammar editor in pharo under
the supervision of Manuel Leuenberger.

My interests lie in computer graphics and visualization tools.
The aim of the thesis is to model
<a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shape_grammar">shape grammars</a> which are a type of formal grammar working on 2d(or 3d) meshes and to write an editor with which rules can easily be drawn and images generated from the given rules.
The algorithm used to find subshapes in bigger shapes uses local coordinates and homogenous transformations to handle translations, rotations and scaling in a uniform manner.
