Hi! My name is Noah and I'm studying for a bachelors degree at Uni Bern. I'm joining the Software Composition Group to write my bachelor thesis.

In my project I will classify Github pull requests and issues into security-related and non-security-related groups and do quantitative and qualitative analysis of security-related pull requests and issues.

More soon...
