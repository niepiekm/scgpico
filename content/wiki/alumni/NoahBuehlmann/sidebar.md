I spend my free time mainly with sports and music.

I do lots of sports but I am mostly into endurance and racket sport. Currently I am doing competitive orienteering, road running and Badminton. Occasionally I also play tennis, squash or table tennis. During my childhood I have also done eight years of competitive swimming.

Since my early childhood I have been doing singing (solo & choir) and I am still going today. Currently I am on tour with "Consonus Vokalensemble". Check out one of our concerts if you like choir music: https://consonus-vokalensemble.com/vier-elemente-fruehling-2020/

As a random funny fact, I am able to solve the standard 3x3x3 Rubik's Cube in just under 30 seconds. I take part in speedcubing competitions from time to time: [https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/persons/2013BUEH01](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/persons/2013BUEH01)
