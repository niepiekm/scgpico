Title: Manuel Friedli

I'm a master student at the University of Bern currently writing my master thesis at the SCG.

I'm looking into improving the security of Android Apps by separating security-sensitive parts from the rest of the app and executing them in a secure environment.
As soon as I've decided upon a catchy title, I'll publish it here.
