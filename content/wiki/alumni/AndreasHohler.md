#Andreas Hohler
Hey, my name is Andi Hohler and I'm a master student at the University of Bern with Computer Science as Major. Beside of that, I founded the company [devedis](https://devedis.ch), where we develop software solutions.

I'm currently working on my master project mentored by [Haidar Osman](%base_url%/staff/Osman).
The project is called **BiCo: Towards an Infrastructure for Repository and Metrics Analysis**. I will build this upon my seminar project called **BiCo: Big Commit Analysis**
This project goes into the topic of bug prediction, where I want to extract source and change metrics of repositories at every commit for all classes. Further a bug prediction AI should be integrated where its accuracy is measured over the software evolution in repositories. This description will likely be extended.
