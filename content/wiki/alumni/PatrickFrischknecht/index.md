Phishing websites try to mimic trustworthy sites as close as possible to trick users into passing them sensitive private information like login data. 

A typical security tip to protect the users from phishing is to check the URL, especially the domain name of the page before entering data. However phishers can also try to create domains looking very similar to the trusted domain (so called look-alike domains) by changing a few letters of the original domain name, adding additional words etc. 

The goal of the master thesis is to study the prevalence of phishing attacks with look-alike domains and how companies protect their domains and more generally their brands from such attacks.
