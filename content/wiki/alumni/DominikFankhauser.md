I'm a bachelor student currently working on my bachelor's thesis under the supervision of Claudio Corrodi. During my work as a board member of a sports club, I recognized some problems in the domains member and event management. Currently existing software solutions cover either one or the other topic, but not both. So the goal of the project is to create an application that allows clubs to do their member management and their event management in one application. Furthermore, club members should be able to see upcoming events and to register if they want to help at a particular event.
