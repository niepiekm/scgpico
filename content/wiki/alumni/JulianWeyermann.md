I'm trying out the "Oracle Database Multilingual Engine" and creating a technical demo for it.
Using Javascript and being able to execute it directly in the Database using GraalVM, my goal is to generate PDF reports on the DB using JS libraries like `pdfmake` or `jspdf`.
Further goals are allowing the PDFs style to be defined using a JSON file and finally writing a small NodeJS application which allows customizing the PDF which uses the functionality just discussed.
