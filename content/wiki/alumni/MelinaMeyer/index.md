My bachelor thesis is about "living user stories". 

Since user stories are widely used in agile requirements engineering, there are multiple commercially available tools. However, it is a tedious task to trace and validate the user stories against the code since the management tools and development environment are independent. 

Our solution will be a storyboard in the GlamorousToolkit IDE with the most required features of a "normal" storyboard. Since the board is integrated in the development environment, it allows us to visibly link user stories to its implementation and therefore provide much more dynamic information to technical and non-technical stakeholders, improving collaboration and communication between them.
