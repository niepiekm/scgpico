There are no guaranteed office times. However, based on pragmatic considerations, chances are high to meet me monday afternoon, or around midnight on the day of a conference deadline.

For history aficionados, the institute is located in the building of the former "Thierarzneischule" (school of veterinary science), which has been built in the 1890ies and renovated in 1992-96. For more information, please refer to the [Architekturführer der Universität Bern (in German)](http://www.bau.unibe.ch/architektur/engeh_tierspital/engeh_tierspital01.htm).
