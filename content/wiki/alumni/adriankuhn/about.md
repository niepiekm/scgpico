<img align="right" src="http://www.iam.unibe.ch/~akuhn/img/adriankuhn.jpg" style="margin-right:0px; height:26.667ex; width: 20ex;" title="Adrian Kuhn at ECOOP 2007 in Berlin."/>I received my PhD from the University of Bern in 2011. This is my website from when I was with the [Software Composition Group](%base_url%/) in Bern. My advisor was [Oscar Nierstrasz](%base_url%/staff/oscar). 

<i>"I am in love with programming languages."</i>

My main research interests are human-computer interaction in software engineering and programming languages (HCI, SE, PL). I have been working on development tools, mainly using data mining and information visualization, and on dynamic programming languages. At the moment, I'm working on [Software Cartography](%base_url%/research/softwarecartography).
