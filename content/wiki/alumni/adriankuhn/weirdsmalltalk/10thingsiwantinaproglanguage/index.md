Title: 10 Things I want in a Prog Language
---

In no particular order


-  Image like Smalltalk, but file based source management


-  Easy acces to AST of closures


-  Traversal API, an object query language


-  Prototype based system (not classes) & customizable lookup


-  Method namespaces, extension methods, etc


-  Custom literals, eg XML document and Regular Expressions


-  Something beyond classes and packages, eg interfaces, class boxes, nested classes etc


-  Some type information, maybe runtime checks instead of static checks


-  No null beyond method scope


-  Collective behavior


-  Browseable stack trace, hot code swapping, resumeable exceptions


-  Strong tools for inspecting, debugging and refactoring


-  Everything is an object


-  Does not understand
