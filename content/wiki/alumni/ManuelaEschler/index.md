We all know Google search and appreciate it very much, but when it comes to search for learning content (WBT, Plain Text, Video) you ought to know how to search to get a useful result.

The purpose of my bachelor's thesis is to determine the most efficient way to search for learning content within a learning management system. How to enter the search parameters? How to display the results? How to index the learning content to get the most precise matches? To hopefully not learn that it is the way of google search.

This project is supervised by Oscar Nierstrasz.
