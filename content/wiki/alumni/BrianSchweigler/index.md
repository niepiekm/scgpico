#Hello there,

During my BSc thesis I will investigate online vulnerability databases, where I focus on the history of CVSS records and their distribution across different database providers. 

In order to perform this task, I first plan to collect some background on vulnerability reporting, before I will have a look at individual entries in the CVE, and finally some peer reviewed papers to acquire a sense for the topic.
I'm working under the supervision of Pascal Gadient and Prof. Dr. Oscar Nierstrasz.
