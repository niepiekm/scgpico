Title: How to replicate from Store to Store
---


- Put both accounts in the Store favorite list (e.g. "user at scg" and "user at cincom")
- Connect to the Cincom Public Store
- Load StoreForGlorpVWUI package
- Go to Store/Replicate
- In the window choose the Source database (e.g. "user at scg") and the Target database (e.g. "user at cincom")
- Choose the "Preferred" bundle/package from the Source list
- Press the ">>" button
- Wait until the "Preferred" bundle/package disappeared from the list on the right

Options:

-  If you do not want to replicate the entire history, unselect the Replicate Recurtsively checkbox (just above the red button on the bottom right)
-  If you do not see the wanted bundle/package on the left, you should try unselecting the "Published in the last days" or "Published By" checkbox
-  If you want to fix the blessing level of already replicated versions, check the "Fix Existing Versions" in the Options menu
