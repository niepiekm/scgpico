#How to connect to the printer via the printer server
# For the iamlw100s printer
The iamlw100s printer is in the first (upper) floor.

-  open the Printer Browser
-  choose the Default Browser tab (from the top left of the window)
-  select the iamlw100s for the first floor


If you are located in the second floor, go to Jacek, he'll do stuff for you. Or, try this: Choose "IP" view, and then the IPP method. The printer name is iamlw200s. Do NOT choose the Generic postscript driver, because it won't print anything. Instead, choose the correct HP hardware driver from the list. 

When printing, it is essential to verify that once the print has finished, the job is indeed terminated. In a good amount of the cases, you'll have to do that yourself. If you fail to terminate the print job yourself, the printer will keep re-printing your potentially confidential document over and over.
