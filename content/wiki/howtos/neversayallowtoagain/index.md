The construct <I>allow to</I> (or <I>allows to</I>) is not correct in English, since <I>allow</I> must take an object.  The following examples are from various thesis drafts, and illustrate what to avoid:

---
<I>Unfortunately, this type does not allow to use arbitrary (user  defined) types in the component interfaces...</I>
You must supply the object, as in <I>allow</I> <B>programmers</B> <I>to use</I>.

---
<I>Removing an entity from this selection, for example a class, causes  also to remove all entities which are associated with it ...</I>  
You can't say <I>causes to remove</I> since the object is missing.  Use active voice by introducing a object (<I>causes CodeCrawler to remove</I>) or use the passive voice (<I>causes all entities to be removed</I>).

---
<I>We advise to remove all stand-alone nodes from the graph, as they  are of no use in this case.</I>
Same problem.  Better would be: <I>We advise</I> <B>the user</B> <I>to remove</I> ...

---
All of these examples require an object, such as <I>the user</I>, or <I>one</I>.
<I>A composition language must allow to make the architecture of an  application explicit in the corresponding source code.</I>
<I>A weakly typed language ...  allows to reuse components in a way  not foreseen by the designer.</I>
<I>...  there exist many scripting languages which allow to port  their source to different platforms or environments ...</I>  
<I>Each Bourne shell script has a set of predefined variables which  allow to easily access the command line arguments passed to the  script ...</I>
<I>... the runtime system allows to pin such objects ...</I>
<I>We claim that any well-developed system for software composition  should allow to specify such dependencies and solve the  corresponding problems automatically.</I>
<I>A cleaner solution of this problem would be to define a (possibly  configurable) adaptor for foo which allows to invoke the service also under the name bar.</I>
