Title: How to make sure your paper appears correctly in the SCG Publications
---


-  Once the paper has been published add citation details to the paper. For example:

title{Correlating Features and Code \\ Using A Compact Two-Sided Trace Analysis Approachthanks{Proceedings of CSMR 2005 (9th European Conference on Software Maintenance and Reengineering) pages 314-323}}

In certain styles you cannot include the citation in the title. In this case put it in the abstract.


-  Copy the PDF file to [/archive/papers](/archive/papers)
	-  The name of the PDF should start with the citation key, for example, if the key is Gree05a, then the PDF might be called Gree05aCSMR2005Features.pdf



-  Verify the pdf on the [scg publications web](%base_url%/publications/scg-pub)


-  Update the scg bib following the instructions in the [README file in the scgbib project](https://www.iam.unibe.ch/scg/svn_repos/scgbib/)
