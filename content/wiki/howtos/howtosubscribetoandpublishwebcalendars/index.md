---

#Subscribing to a calendar
You can subscribe to a calendar of the scg via:

webcal://asterix.unibe.ch/ical/foo.ics

where foo is the name of the calendar.

See also the list of all known scg [ICal Calendar Publishers](%base_url%/wiki/howtos/howtosubscribetoandpublishwebcalendars/icalcalendarpublishers)
##Unix and win32
Use [Mozilla Calendar](http://www.mozilla.org/projects/calendar)

##Fallback solution
Browse to [http://www.designtheworld.com/iwebcal/](http://www.designtheworld.com/iwebcal/) and put
the full qualified name of  your calendar. (see above)

Bookmark the resulting page. 
Take care though, they might put your calendar as an example (What people are doing with our great software...) on their webpage.

##Publishing a Calendar
You can also publish your calendars with ical, if you choose

- Calendar&mdash;>Publish 
- then select Publish on a webserver
- then enter the following Url: http://www.iam.unibe.ch/ical
You must also specify the login and password! (ask the [Password Keeper](%base_url%/wiki/scgjoblist/passwordkeeper))

Be sure to drink your Ovaltine.
