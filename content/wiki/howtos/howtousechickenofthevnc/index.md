You can use Chicken of the VNC to interact with a remote computer as though it's right next to you.

Please download from [http://sourceforge.net/projects/cotvnc/](http://sourceforge.net/projects/cotvnc/)

And then, all you have to do is


-  make sure you are within the university network (use VNP from outside)
-  ask the [Password Keeper](%base_url%/wiki/scgjoblist/passwordkeeper) for the passwd of macamis's services
-  connect to macamis at 130.92.65.106 using the passwd

C'est tout.
