Title: How to order books
---

If you want an ebook, before ordering please check whether it is accessible through the [University Library](http://www.unibe.ch/university/services/university_library/research/e_books/index_eng.html).

Please note that since the INF (and SCG) library have moved to the ExWi building there is now a new procedure for ordering books.

We should no longer order books directly, but only through the library.  (Only very exceptionally can we buy books directly, for example if they are available only at a conference we are attending.)

The book order form and the procedure are here:


-  [Order form](http://scg.unibe.ch/download/forms/INFBookOrderingForm.pdf)
-  [Procedure](http://scg.unibe.ch/download/forms/BuchbestellungenIAM-Personal_eng.pdf)

Please fill in the order form (the part about book information) and send it to [Nitish Patkar](%base_url%/staff/NitishPatkar) (or [Pooja Rani](%base_url%/staff/Pooja-Rani) in his absence).

It is still possible to order books for permanent loan to our offices.  The library will deliver such books to us once a week.

New: it is possible to mark books available to our students (“semester depository”) for courses.
