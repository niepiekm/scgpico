#How to use the Canon Color printer
Best is to have a look at the user manual (it's placed near the printer).

In general: Install the drivers. The CD image is on Bigmac: CANONpixma.dmg

If the printer complains that it cannot print because you need to open the printer output tray, beware! It is not the door on top of the printer but the (secret) panel in the front. Push it and the output tray will pop open.
