#How to copy your data from your old Mac to your new mac at installation
When asked during the installation if you want to copy data from your old mac then:


-  Connect a firewire cable from the new to the old mac
-  Shutdown the old mac and power it back up at the same time holding down the 't' key. On the old mac a firewire symbol appears on the screen. On the new mac you can select which data you want to copy and then press 'continue'.
-  wait...

You can also sync just essential files and sync the rest later by running Migration Assistant (it's in Applications>Utilities)
That's it. You now have your data on the new mac. Somethings will not work as you expect though...
To solve this you need to do the following:

-  Connect to macamis
-  mount the drive where the scgResources are
-  install X11 (needed for VisualWorks)
-  install XCode (needed for CVS)
-  install MacTeX and TeXShop
-  install Subversion
