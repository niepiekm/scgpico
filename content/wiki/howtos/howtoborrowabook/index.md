#How to borrow a book
Each book in SCG library has been entered in our catalog available at [Library Thing](https://www.librarything.com/catalog/scg).

For each book in the "Comments" column there is the information of where the book should be.

If you borrow a book, please tag it appropriately in the "Tags" columns.
For example, @NM means that Nevena Milojkovic borrowed the book.

When you return the book to its place, please remove the tag.
