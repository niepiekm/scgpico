#How to Fill out Travel Expenses when you get back from a Trip
The expenses form is available at: [Spesen-Form](%assets_url%/download/forms/)

Our expenses are paid either by the Canton or by SNF.

When your expenses are paid by the canton: 

-  Accomodation: No maximun costs per night anymore, but you need receipts from the hotel which should be a medium cost hotel at best, ie. 2 to 3 stars.
-  Food (Lunch and Dinner): 40 CHF per day. To be on the safe side, provide receipts for food.

When your expenses are paid by the SNF


-  Food (Lunch and Dinner): 40 CHF per day. To be on the safe side, provide receipts for food.

example:

Pauschal ( 5 Tage a 40 CHF)

Make sure you have your certificate of attendance at the conference. You NEED to include this with your expenses claim.

Before you print the expenses form:

-  make sure you have put your name, address, bank account details and the name and dates of the conference on the form.
-  make sure to check that the form prints on one page.
