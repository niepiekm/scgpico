# Hyphenate adjectives, not nouns

"Object-oriented" is hyphenated, but "use case" is not.

- run time &mdash; noun, the time at which the system runs (not hyphenated)
- run-time &mdash; an adjective describing something which exists at run time  (hyphenated)
- runtime &mdash; noun, the run-time support, e.g. the VM ([portmanteau word](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portmanteau) combining "run" and "time")


**Wrong:** ”Run-time errors are caught by the run-time at run-time.”

**Right:** ”Run-time errors are caught by the runtime at run time.”
