#Don't join sentences with commas
In German you can join clauses with commas; in English you must make them separate sentences, or you may join them with colons ( : ), semi-colons ( ; ), dashes (&mdash;), or conjunctions (and ...).

**Wrong:** "RetroVue is another commercial back-in-time debugger, it implements the most common functions."

**Right:** "RetroVue is another commercial back-in-time debugger; it implements the most common functions."

This is also known as a [comma splice](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma_splice).
