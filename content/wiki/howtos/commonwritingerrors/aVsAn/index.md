Title: A vs. an

#A vs. an

#"A" vs. "an"
Use "a" if the first letter of the following word is pronounced as a consonant.

**Wrong:** "A historical view of an UML diagram is better than a XML document."

**Right:** "An historical view of a UML diagram is better than <u>an</u> XML document."
Note the pronunciation, which is what counts:

-  "An istorical view" [NB: Americans might prefer "A historical view" after all.]
-  "a yoo-em-ell diagram"
-  "an ex-em-ell document"
