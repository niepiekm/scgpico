Title: Get the Lead Out

# Get the "Lead" Out

This is a surprisingly common error. The past tense of "to lead" is "led", not "lead". [The word "lead" that sounds like "led" is a gray metal that has nothing to do with leading."

**Wrong:** "These changes have lead to improved performance."

**Right:** "These changes have led to improved performance."
