Title: Such that vs so that

# "Such that" vs "so that"

"Such that" means "to the extent that" ("my grammar is such that it is beyond reproach") while "so that" means "in order to" ("I study grammar so that I am beyond reproach"). Don't confuse them.

**Wrong:** "The tasks are decoupled from each other, *such that* they can be executed concurrently."

**Right:** "The tasks are decoupled from each other, *so that* they can be executed concurrently."
