#"Which" vs. "that"
Use *that* for *restrictive clauses* (i.e., restricting what is referred to) and *which* for *non-restrictive clauses*.
The acid test is: if you can remove the clause and it still makes sense, use *which*, otherwise use *that*.

**Wrong:** "This is shown in the following method that is invoked by the interpreter."

**Right:** "This is shown in the following method, which is invoked by the interpreter."

(You can remove the whole "which ..." and it makes sense.)


**Wrong:** "We call the equivalent parts which describe the same feature `building blocks'."

**Right:** "We call the equivalent parts that describe the same feature `building blocks'."

(You cannot remove the qualifying text.)

Note that many authors confuse "which" and "that", but there is a clear semantic difference. Consider the two following statements:


- *You should write a PhD thesis, which will further your academic career.*
- *You should write a PhD thesis that will further your academic career.*

Both are grammatically correct, but the first states that writing any PhD thesis will further your career, whereas the second suggests that you should write a particular kind of thesis that will be good for your career. Note that a comma is needed to introduce the non-restrictive clause.

*Caveat:* Actually it is common in English to use "which" instead of "that" also for restrictive clauses, as in:


- *You should write a PhD thesis which will further your academic career.*

(Note the absence of the comma!) In many cases this will cause no confusion, but wherever it might (like here), it makes good sense to maintain a clear distinction and use "which" only for non-restrictive clauses.
