# Software &mdash; countable or uncountable?

Software should be used as a [mass noun](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_noun) (uncountable noun), like hardware. However, it is gaining countability in specific contexts. Think of it like *paper*: you can say "Paper is recyclable" (mass noun) or "Here is a new paper" (countable). "Software" has no plural form, though. 

**Wrong:** “I bought a new software.”

**Right:** “I bought a new piece of software.” “I bought some new software.”
