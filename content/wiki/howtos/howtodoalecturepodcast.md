#How to do a lecture podcast
This guide leads you through the creation, recording, and post-processing of a public lecture podcast in the room E001.
It is possible to create students-only podcasts through Ilias, please refer to [http://podcast.unibe.ch](http://podcast.unibe.ch) if you do not want a public podcast.

Check the known issues sections if you struggle with the guide before calling support.

Note that the lecture room hardware is managed by the facility management, so call them if you have hardware issues that are not covered in this guide.
The software infrastructure is managed by SWITCH, contact the university support for podcast software related issues (telephone 031 631 31 91).

#Automated recording of a series

From HS18 on the podcast series can be ordered to be recurrent and automatically recorded using this form.
The recording for each lecture is then scheduled and records and uploads the lecture automatically in a specified time window.
Once the registration is done by the podcast support, you can then see your series in [https://cast.switch.ch](https://cast.switch.ch).
Do not forget to use the microphone during the lecture though, and post-processing is still needed, see below.

##My newly created series is not showing up in *SWITCHcast Recorder* even after authenticating

This is only necessary the first time, once selected the series will stay in the shortlist.
