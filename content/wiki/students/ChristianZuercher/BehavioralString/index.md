Title: Behavioral String
---

#Project Idea

Strings are currently rather dumb. They do not have any knowledge about their content. Therefore, the String data type remains the most prevalent source of data leaks. But unfortunately, changing the String class usually introduces compatibility issues.

In this master's project, we aspire to create a solution that gets the best out of both worlds: Strings act dependent on their content all without breaking existing applications.
