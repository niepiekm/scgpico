I am a master's student in the SCG.

I already wrote my bachelor's thesis in the SCG in the field of "Unit-Test Name recommendations". The work involved finding the focal methods (F-MUTs) of a Unit-Test and determining the intent(s) of the test case. This work was supervised by Dr. Mohammad Ghafari and Prof. Dr. Oscar Nierstrasz.

I am now writing my master's thesis that intends to make strings behavioral when necessary so that they can follow specified rules while still being compatible with already existing code.

Supervisors: Pascal Gadient, Prof. Dr. Oscar Nierstrasz
