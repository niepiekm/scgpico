Title: Categorizing Test Smells
---

#Goal:


-  identify best practices and anti-patterns in the state of the art and compare with common wisdom 

#Prior work


-  Gaelli & Wampfler did manually look at tests

#Practices


-  both positive and negative


-  e.g. tests should be independent, mock objects, assertions, composed tests, etc.

#Strategies for detecting best practices and anti-patterns 


-  look at papers and extract recommendations and anti-patterns
-  look at testing codes, list attributes, and categorize them
-  talk to people and ask them about their practice

Afterwards look at automatic analysis, classification and detection for larger corpus.
