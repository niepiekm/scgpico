Title: Studying the prevalence of security issues in Android
---

#Project Idea

<div align="justify">
The presence of sensitive information such as contacts, messages, browsing history, online  transactions, and etc. has attracted a myriad of cyber-criminals towards smartphones. 
Android is the determined champion of Operating Systems in the world of smartphones, and academia has allocated a considerable effort into Android security improvement. However, the actual gains are yet unknown.  

In this project we will employ existing techniques to mine related data (e.g., in Android issue tracker) and investigate the prevalence of security-related bugs in the Android OS. We want to learn how frequently these bugs are reported, and possibly what their distribution is in different major releases.
