Title: Detecting (potentially) malicious behaviour in mobile apps
---

#Project Idea

<div align="justify">

Smartphones are ubiquitous and increasingly used to access services, such as messaging, media sharing, and financial transactions that few years ago have been available only on PCs. However, amongst millions of mobile apps in different marketplaces, a considerable number of them compromise confidential data and expose them to criminals.   

The goal of this project is to study mobile apps on popular marketplaces and mine critical functionalities in the apps based on both meta data and information flow to finally propose an approach to spot behaviours that have potential to be malicious.
