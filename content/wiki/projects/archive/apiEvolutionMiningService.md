#API Evolution Mining Service
#Project Idea

[API Evolution Miner](http://homepages.dcc.ufmg.br/~mtov/pub/2014_csmrwcre_apievolutionminer.pdf) si an existing tool that mines a project history to detect API changes. This tool is also capable of producing static analyzer rules that detect an old API usage in source code and provide a possibility to automatically change it to the new one.

Although the tool was proven to work well it was never used for two reasons:


-  At the time when it was developed [Pharo](http://pharo.org) didn't have a nice UI for reporting critics generated by the rules.
-  You had to setup API Evolution Miner by yourself and manually recover the rules.

While the first issue is currently mitigated by [QualityAssistant](https://github.com/Uko/QualityAssistant), the second one still persists.

The goal of this project is to create a continuous integration service that will allow to easily register your projects and will provide rules to you in a semi-intrusive way when they are ready.
