Title: A replication study on bug prediction

#A replication study on bug prediction
#Project Idea:

Recently, we have carried out a bug prediction study on the Eclipse JDT Core dataset. We had some interesting findings. We want to confirm these findings by replicating the study on more datasets.

#Implementation Roadmap:

The datasets are ready. The study method is defined. The infrastructure is in place. All you need to do is to replicate the study step by step on the prepared datasets.
