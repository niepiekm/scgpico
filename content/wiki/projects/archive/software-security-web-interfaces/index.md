#Privacy concerns in public web APIs
#Overview
Recent mobile applications frequently utilize client-server implementations, e.g., for social interactions and other cloud services. Within these implementations SOAP and JSON protocols became quite popular for data transmissions. The goal of this project is to assess the potential risks caused by server-side interfaces that originate from these client-server implementations.<br>

Your task will consist of:<br>

- Evaluation of the state-of-the-art
- Design of attacks
- Construction and execution of attacks
