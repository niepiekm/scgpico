#How are Software Visualizations Evaluated?
#Overview

Abundant techniques have been proposed in the software visualization community to tackle specific development problems. A vast number of design studies have shown how visualization techniques support users to solve a task. However, a frequent argument against software visualizations is the lack of evaluations. We wonder: *What type of evaluations are used?* *Are evaluations mostly quantitative?* *Are evaluations reproducible?*      

#Tasks
In this project you will perform a systematic literature review to answer the question: how software visualizations are evaluated? That is, in a reproducible fashion you will (1) gather a corpus of relevant literature, (2) define criteria to include/exclude studies, (3) extract and analyze the data and (4) report.
