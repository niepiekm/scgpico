Title: Understanding Program Comprehension
---
#Understanding Program Comprehension
Developers spend most of their time performing program comprehension. Understanding source code can be a very difficult task, especially in large software systems. Object-oriented features like polymorphism, and the problem of the lack of static type information hampers that process.

In this project we aim to investigate how heavy use of object-oriented features influence program understanding process.

#Roadmap:

-  find a program understanding task in a software system which uses a lot object-oriented features 
-  observe a couple of developers during these program understanding tasks
-  draw a meaningful conclusions about these sessions and encountered problems
