Title: Automatic Token Classification

#An attempt to mine useful information for parsing
Developers need software models to make decisions while developing
software systems. Static software models are commonly imported by parsing
source code. But building a custom parser is a difficult task in most
programming languages. To build such a custom parser the grammar of the
programming language is needed. If the grammar is not available, which is
the case for many languages and notably dialects, it has to be inferred from
the source code. Automatically finding the keywords of those languages can
help the process of inferring a grammar because many keywords identify
beginnings and endings of the basic building blocks of programs.
