Title: Parsing F# with Petit Parser
---
#Parsing F# with Petit Parser
The goal of this project is to implement F# grammar in Petit Parser.
F# is an indentation sensitive language.
It means that the spaces and tabulators matters and might change syntax of a program.
Petit Parser is a Parsing Expression Grammar based framework which was recently extended with support for indentation sensitive languages.

In this work a student:

-  is supposed to implement F# grammar in Petit Parser, 
-  parse significant amount of F# sources as a validation of an implementation and 
-  measure the performance of indentation sensitive features.

The project is currently assigned as a bachelors project.
