Title: SCodeBubbles
---

The **SCodeBubbles** project explores how CodeBubbles could profit from a dynamic programming environment such as Pharo Smalltalk. It is the Bachelor's project of [Aaron Karper](http://scg.unibe.ch/wiki/students/AaronKarper) and [Dominique Rahm](http://scg.unibe.ch/wiki/students/DominiqueRahm).

[CodeBubbles is an IDE and GUI framework by Andrew Bragdon that works unlike traditional windowing concepts.  It shows code and other objects of interest not as windows, but as bubbles, that can never overlap.](http://www.cs.brown.edu/people/acb/codebubbles_site.htm)
