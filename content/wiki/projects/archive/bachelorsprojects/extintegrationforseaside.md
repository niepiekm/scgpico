---
#Ext Integration for Seaside
[Ext](http://extjs.com/) is UI component framework built on top of [Prototype](http://www.prototypejs.org/) and [script.aculo.us](http://script.aculo.us/). The goal of this project is to integrate the Widgets of Ext as closely as possible into the Seaside component model.
