#Visualizations for Eclipse
Eclipse, as great as it is as a development environment, still lacks software visualization. This project's goal is to take the most popular visualizations used in [Moose](http://moose.unibe.ch) and port them to Eclipse. This may also include porting [Mondrian](http://moose.unibe.ch/tools/Mondrian) to Java, but you are free to use any visualization framework. Mondrian needs a dynamic language for its scripting facility. We suggest to use Groovy, or Rhino the new Javascript engine of Java 6.

What you should know


-  Java Skills
-  Any drawing framework
-  Implementing algorithms
-  Interest in Dynamic Languages and Scripting

What you will learn


-  Eclipse plugin development

-  Dyanmic Language and Scripting
-  Software Analysis
-  Software Metrics

-  Information visualization
-  Gestalt principle
