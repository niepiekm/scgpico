#A Decade of Software Engineering
(The Evolution of OO Design Principles)

In this project you will study how did the practice of OO Design Principles evolve over time. The project has two components:


-  building up a representative corpus of software systems from two given points in time
-  encoding a representative sample of the OO Design Heuristics of Arthur Riel.
