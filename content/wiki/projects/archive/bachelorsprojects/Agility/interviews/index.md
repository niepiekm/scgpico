**Brainstorming for interview questions:**

- Which tools used? The same tools/features of tools for all the iterations? Is there any particular stage of the project where you need particular features/tools more than in the other stages of project?


- Representation of bugs as stories -> how do you handle bugs? As new entries (new stories) or in some different way?


- How is sprint retrospective in reality handled? Importance? Do you do a sprint retrospective after every sprint? Does the product owner participate? Is the scrum retrospective meeting time-boxed? If impediments are found, how do you proceed? Are impediments a Scrum Master task?


- Experiences in introduction phase of Scrum? How is the new "mentality" handled? Tool support for introduction in particular?
