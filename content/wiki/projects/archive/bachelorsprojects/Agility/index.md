Title: Agile and scrum
---

Scrum and other agile methodologies are now widely accepted in practice. In Scrum, the work is organized in user stories and the customer is responsible for their organization in a product backlog. At the end of each iteration, the progress is reviewed and priorities are re-evaluated. During the iteration, daily meetings take place to set direction and focus. The overall emphasis is on the incremental delivery of working functionality and the reduction of work-in-progress.

Despite a rich literature on the subject, more evidence-based research is needed to understand how agile works, and why it works, in practice.
