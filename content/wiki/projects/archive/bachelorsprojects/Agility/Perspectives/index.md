#Perspectives
**Favourite Perspectives candidates for matrix**

- How to capture tasks, bug report, etc. into user stories effectively
- Are tools better suited for certain iterations of the project (e.g. not appropriate for early iteration or for roll-out)
- Are there aspects in the tools for sprint retrospective in particular in order to improve the Scrum process in an efficient way?
-  How can the Scrum Master support and help the team with regard to the tool? Is the function/existance of such a Scrum Master considered in the tool?
- Do the tools just work with a "scrum-ready" team, or do they also support introduction of Scrum in the enterprise?

**Perspectives for the matrix (Brainstorm):**


- How to capture tasks, bug report, etc. into user stories effectively
- Are tools better suited for certain iterations of the project (e.g. not appropriate for early iteration or for roll-out)
- How is the reduction of work in progress handled?
- Concept of ownership/expertise vs. equally skilled team members as promoted by Scrum
- How may tools improve the product backlog refinement process?
- Are there aspects in the tools for sprint retrospective in particular in order to improve the Scrum process in an efficient way?
- Sprint burndown chart as a tool or as a "paper on the wall" -> requirements?
- Do the tools just work with a "scrum-ready" team, or do they also support introduction of Scrum in the enterprise?
- "The rules, roles, and time-boxes of Scrum are few and simple. Whenever they cause a conflict with existing practices, an impediment has been encountered and made visible. The enterprise has to choose whether to change to remove the impediment or to give up on some of the benefits." (B.Schwaber - The enterprise and Scrum) Does the tool represent these impediments (or examples of such impediments)?
-  How can the Scrum Master support and help the team with regard to the tool? Is the function/existance of such a Scrum Master considered in the tool?
