Title: Rainer Grau - Project 1
---

**Rainer Grau**

6 years experience
training course at uni rapperswill
5 projects
longest one: < 2 yrs.
longest one: 18 month

**Background about the project**

The most interesting one: master work from university, 7 month, 5people, 2 weeks sprint length

The teams were distributed, except for the meeting
It was an ERP project based on OpenERP

**How decisions were taken**

Prod owner take priorities, team put the card in the sprint.
Visible change during the project: velocity. At first it was bad, then improved. The team improved how to handle the additional work (not pure user stories): how to estimate that? how to organize this work? add extra card? add to user story?

*\==> Theme: Non-functional req. *

**How retrospective were conducted**


Main problem was trouble with collaboration. One guy was far ahead of the other. Other had hard time to follow. Social trouble. Scrum master was part of the problem as well.

*\==> Theme: interpersonal issue outweight other problems*

During the retrospective, the team identified impact on the dev. project, renewed done criteria, renewed new types of dev. or deployment strategy. New task card for the next sprint.

Task card to mitigate the impediments. Not in **trac**, except as picture taken and stored in trac. Done criteria written on card on the **pinboard**. Main defect on card of pinboard. 

Support from OpenERP for **bugtracking**.

**About trac**

The team decided to use trac.

Plus: web based, easy to use, easy to access
Minus: some trouble with using it as Scrum like (not adapted?), list of tasks and activities, but not card, not estimation process, no planning poker (done in the meeting and needed to be reported in the tool later - overhead). 

*\==> Theme: reporting/reflection/sync information amongs tools/meeting/artefacts*

Scrum plug-in, pretty nice, but not so useful: template for user stories, but no overview, no product, release, sprint backlog was not so easy. Burt down chart from trac didn't work.

Otherwise, source & configuration management, label over documents.

*\==> Theme: versioning of information, and update of information over the project*

No scrum roles &mdash; all teams had the same view. Only admin/regular users.

*\==> Theme: how to keep visibility over the project and team memebers*

**Pain point in the process**


-  Distributed team, negative impact, overhead in communication
-  Not a nice management of user stories
-  Restriction that the tool force granularity because they are structured. We don't care about this granularity. It's here and estimated. We can only pull items of certain granularity &mdash; this restriction is artificial. 

*\==> Theme: Artificial constraint/flexiblity needed by the tools*


-  Feature, user stories at product level is hard to decide. Product level vs. project level. What to keep when project is over. What to keep is hard decision and we are missing tool for that. What kind of info has to survive a project.
-  Test case, SAD, req/user stories need to be discussed with business people, non-functional requirements, knowledge is in the team (team alive) or you document it, what if the team is release and your start a new team. Team knowledge. Problem of team knowledge w.r.t. Scrum is not completely satisfying. 

*\==> Theme: Product vs. project level mgmt*

**Knowledge sharing**


-  Pair programming, learning session with team member.
-  Documentation: SAD, UML, Release notes, deployment notes.
-  Document were created on demand of the team

Only stored stuff in **trac** that are need for the product. Daily project management was done with **pinboard** and that was fine.  Arrow where written on the release backlog for what needs to be delivered.
