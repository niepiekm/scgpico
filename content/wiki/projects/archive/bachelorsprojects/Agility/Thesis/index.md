**Structure**

- Introduction
- Goal of the research
	-  Motivation to do the research
	-  Core research question

- Scrum
	-  Scrum 101

- Interviews
	-  (how were they done / what did I get to know / themes & assumptions) -> pick 
	-  quotations from interview
	-  Common feedback "scrum need no tool"
	-  But reality is more complicated and they use tool
	-  How Scrum fits in a bigger picture (\*)
	-  Lesson learned about how scrum is adapted/used (synthesis of key elements of the interviews, reccuring themes, problems)

- Survey based on the interview 
	-  Why we must better understand the real needs, the daily one AND the occasional ones (ref to \*)
	-  The elaboration of a general set of needs that work for most IT tools
	-  The elaboration of a general set of feature that work for most IT tools
	-  what are the assumptions I did, what do I not cover from the themes of the interviews

- Results from the interviews and the survey 
	-  Discussion of the importance of the needs (that should confirm that daily things which corresponds to the "simple view" are very important and fullfilled with SW, but there are other occcasional need, which less importance, but enough importance, to justify extra tools (e.g. reporting?) )
	-  conferm quotations in the interview with survey (?), spider charts 
	-  Link results with the interview (e.g. problem of compliance, scrum within other process, scrum as a process, or scrum/agile as a development guideline (e.g. test coverage). (idem)
	-  Other things we can say based on the data
	-  Profiles of tools & roles, spider charts

-  The limits of tool
	-  area of improvement (matrix need/satisfaction)
	-  What are the limits of the area where tool can help (e.g. inter-personal issue)
	-  How could we make tools no-intrusive & integrated
	-  Interest & belief of people in such tools or platform

-  Proposal of a prototype (description, screenshots and so on)
-  Conclusion, e.g. further research that can be done
-  Appendix
- Management summary
