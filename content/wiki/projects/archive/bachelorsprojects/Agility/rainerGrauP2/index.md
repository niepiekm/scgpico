#Rainer Grau - Project 2
**Project background**


-  Product development for swiss financial institue
-  Monthly sprint, due to regulation for reporting KPI
-  Intelligent enterprise application bus, where items where trades, connector, integration project, heterogeneous technologies
-  7 people
-  Daily meeting was a twice-weekly meeting actually.
-  Team was collocated.

**User stories**

Feature list in **MS project**, organize high-level features in MS project plan and assigned that in iteration
Project lead discussed with the team the next feature set
Reporting done by project lead
Backlog was an **excel worksheet**, one sheet one sprint
Breakdown from feature to task and assignment by team member
All tracking, effort cost done in excel worksheet
**clearcase** SCM was storing everything. It was Office tools \+ SCM
Word: SAD, Vision doc, Risk Mgmgt, Deployment concepts

*\==> Theme: update of information over the time*

**Retrospective and review**

Infrastructure project &mdash;> nothing to show, harder for review
Thouroughtly tesitng
Review as very short, just collecting the tests, smoke tests, etc.

**Decision**

Who decided when something was "done": the project lead had the final decision
Driven by NF requirement by stakeholder.
NF req are problematic for Scrum project. Orthogonal to fun req. Essential for ESB.

*\==> Theme: how to cope with non-functional req*

**Refinement of the process over time**

MS project template was too much "plan when you plan" &mdash;> skip everything, 20 entries instead of 200
**Simple project tracker** used to ask question/answer, get in touch with stakeholder    
Official review word document from the backlog.
Overhead to reflect things discussed in simple project tracker into Excel and review doc.

*\==> Theme: overhead to keep source of information syncrhonized*

**HP Quality center** for bug reporting. Integrated in Eclipse and visual studio.

**Discussion on the process**

Plus:
MS project is a good tool if used correctly.
Excel for Sprint backlog was easy to handle.
Source code in clear case. Having one repository was handy.
Simple project tracker was easy to use. Ticketing system. Configure list, entry types, etc. Break down of tasks out of excel, etc.
Not integrated into anything, no way to import, export. Copy paste. Stuff there were throw away.
Project plan is the project history, simple project tracker was just for collaboration.

**Pinboard** and card is the best for daily collocated teams.
More problematic to know what are the expectations for long term vision. 
The bank had a clear concept was is on project and what is on product level.

*\==> Theme: product vs project level mgmt*

Minus:
No visibility for the team. No pinboard. Was ok because team was great. People knew where they were. Does not scale if team size increases. E.g. distributed teams. These tool would not have worked for other project. 

One pager with all critical data (team, timeframe, technologies, etc.) was fine.

*\==> Theme: reporting, progress control, and overall visiblity of the project*

Clear case need a good administration because it's a big software, you need a hotline. Not a lightweight tool.

Nobody like HP quality center.

**Test environment** for mocks and stubs, etc. test automation.

Delivery of documentation is just a user story. Project was more formal but that was ok.

*\==> Theme: how to handle non user-story task, e.g non-fun req.*
