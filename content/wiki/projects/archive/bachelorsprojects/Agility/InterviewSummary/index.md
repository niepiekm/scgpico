#Themes

<b>Non functional requirements and other non user-story tasks</b>

-  special stories: "Fix all high priority bugs" represents bugs that need to be fixed within this sprint, estimated with defensive approach.
-  Backlog Grooming: some time reserved in each sprint to get the backlog ready
-  handled in the same way as functional requirements as they are always doing something for the product
-  Parallel backlog for open issues (e.g. bugs): in the Planning meeting they chosed from Product Backlog and from Issue Backlog. In the last year of the project the focus moved from User Stories to Open Issues. 
-  User stories with status unplanned: Added when something unexpected happened during a sprint, added directly to the sprint backlog (in the sprint planning 40% was added for meetings and unplanned items)
-  Non functional requirements not in the product backlog, but attached to the Use Case in the Architecture Tool (Enterprise Architect) and in Quality Center (provides graphical relations that TFS has not)
-  Different naming conventions for different types of user stories (e.g. real user stories, technical issues, etc) but they were all handled same
-  Non functional requirements were in the acceptance criteria for the relevant user story, not in the definition of done that is relevant for all the user stories. 
-  Scrum Course: Non functional requirements as reminders in Product Backlog, but not estimated or prioritized, because they are valid for all user stories in the backlog. They are in a document apart with detail description.
-  Product Backlog should help the team: What they want to put there, they are allowed to. (e.g. form of the user stories: use case or written text).

<b>reporting/reflecting/synchronization of information / versioning/update of information</b>

-  Overhead to keep information up-to-date
-  Overhead for synchronization done by PO that wanted the tool
-  Overhead for synchronization done by SM or by the team members themself
-  Linking of information in integrated platforms as TFS: code, user story, test case, bug
-  Rather flexible Agilo plug-in for Trac: You can link issues together: you can assign tasks/stories to a sprint and do priorisation. 
-  almost frozen waterfall-similar specifications for a Scrum development process
-  Excel as reporting tool (templates, export from TFS)
-  "That's a problem to have all the documents up to date for everybody."
-  Need to keep track of decisione ("We need also keep track of why we haven't done something")
-  Too many information, cannot find anything; it'S easier to go and ask people
-  Many different places for information: There is the wish to collect all the information in the same place, but they think that technically that might not be realistic (people in different networks, access rights etc.)

<b>Flexibility needed by tools</b>

-  Agilo plug-in for Trac: quite heavily configuration possible: type of issue, type of properties, story points or hours etc.
-  In some tools there are different roles to have different access rights for view: in theory this makes no sense, as it is against transparency (e.g. private bugs in TFS)
-  e.g. different projects in the same product backlog (more Scrum teams working on the same product)
-  TFS can be adapted and enhanced for project-specific needs; changes in process can be done easily
-  "Use of each kind of tools the best": That leads to integration issues

<b>Visibility</b>

-  in e.g. TFS the visibility can be customized for each user by queries
-  No tool so far can replace the visibility of a Scrum Wall (e.g. human factors: someone goes to the wall, hesitation: communication)
-  Visibility for the team brings also transparency for stakeholders
-  Often Scrum Wall requested by the team for visibility, redundancy accepted
-  No resistance from management that tracking was done only on the Scrum Wall, because visibility for them was guaranteed, they could come to the office and see
-  As long as it works well the Scrum Wall there is no need for a tool; exception: dislocated teams
-  Different needs: Developers visibility on the Scrum Wall, Stakeholder want an overview of the different projects on a dashboard 
-  Regular reviews give a visibility/transparency to the stakeholders
-  Scrum Table presented by Fachhochschule Rapperswil: goes in the direction Scrum Wall, but cannot yet replace it. Important missing functionality for offshore: It should be possible to connect 2 Scrum Tables to one TFS and work toghether (and see each others activities).
-  "The GUI of TFS has as much Sex-Appeal as Excel"

<b>Process: Scrum let's you do mistakes and learn from it </b>

-  The team develops the process: must be able to do that in order to succeed with Scrum (not every team can do Scrum) / Team decides how to estimate, whether they want to do Pair Programming, etc.
-  If a team does not want to make a retrospective, they will not do it, even if they should with regard to theoretical Scrum
-  Big change for the developers to get used to the responsability 
-  Team is responsible for quality (it decides what is useful to measure, e.g. test coverage)
-  Changing between the edges of the processes: Scrum in collaboration with non Scrum processes (e.g. hardware) or within a bigger non agile context (e.g. as a pilot project)
-  Daily Scrum Meeting: Piggy-Bank to enter money when you are late
-  Scrum in combination with XP principles to get good quality code: a good process allows quick and save changes

<b>Remote workers</b>

-  Often they use a Scrum Wall, need for tool in particular when dislocated teams or for remote (someone sick at home e.g.)
-  Developers in India, Scrum Master and PO in USA: Main problem was the time difference for the Daily Scrum Meeting (evening late or morning early).

<b>Knowledge Transfer</b>

-  The teams teaches one another; this causes a learning effect also for the teaching person
-  Knowledge of often changing project: Shared knowledge in the team
-  "if one of these guys leave, we are in big trouble, because none can fix the bug"
-  Few education on Scrum for the developers in the introduction: Teams in the beginning acting differently, with time more and more similarly: Best practice
-  2 of the remote developers from India came to USA and then passed the knowledge about agile to the other developers
-  With regard to long-term management of information Scrum provides no solution. It is still the same issue as with a Waterfall-Process. 
-  Sometimes there might be a Product Backlog Item that says "Study 'something' and teach it to the team"

<b>Automation</b>

-  "More than a tool issue we have a technology issue" : A further automation is not possible, because they use different technologies (Linux, Windows) that do not always match
-  Everything checked-in in SVN allows automated setup for a quick install (also JDK etc checked-in for future installations)

<b>Other interesting statements</b>

-  In the backlog items there should be an order, not an priority; because a priority does not imply an order (if you have e.g. 2 items with priority 1, which one is the first one to be implemented?)
-  "A fool with a tool is still a fool"
-  "Tools should solve a problem, and not create other problems"
-  Initial phase of a project with Scrum: No information about requirements engineering provided by Scrum
-  Definition of Undone = all the tasks that are not done yet with regard to the implemented features. This helps to avoid hidden tasks (e.g. update user documentation)
-  Not every project is good to be done agile / with Scrum
-  Not every team is good to implement an agile/Scrum process
