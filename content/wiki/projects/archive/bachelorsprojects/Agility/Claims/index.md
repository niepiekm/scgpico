Title: Claims
---

We need to turn the data collected into the interview and the survey into meaningful facts, that turn, data into knowledge. 

What did we learn? What statement can be reasonably claim about Scrum, issue tracker, the usage of tools, the way people interact with technology?

We can bake our statement either with data from the survey, or quotes of the interview.

We can also elaborate some hypothesis and explanation, e.g. people feel involved when they reach consensus \+ the scrum wall is better than the issue tracker to reach consensus = they feel more involved when using the scrum wall. Sounds a bit silly, but that's one possible interpretation of the data. 

We can also see how satisfied they are with the tool regarding what is considered most important &mdash;> top feature to improve. (matrix satisfactin/need)

Profile of the tools and/or the member roles with spide charts.

```=====
```


-  Team member appreciate the interactivity of the Scrum wall
-  Team member usually consider that "technology goes in the way"
-  There's need to retain knowledge which is not fulfilled by the scrum wall at all
-  People fall in different "profile" with different needs (depends on the outcome of the spider chart) 
-  People interact more with SW than issue tracker (e.g. frequency of when they enter user story). Investigate why?
-  The SW is more polarized: it shines in certain area (e.g. know what other do), and fail completely in other (e.g. retain knowledge). Issue tracker have more "flat" answers: they support everything but with less satisfaction.
-  Reaching consensus/taking decision is central (feel invovled, is perceived as very important) but SW and IT do support it only "average". Can we improve this? Is the issue inherently related to people? Can other artefacts help (e.g. Scrum cards with votes)? etc.
-  Emphasis is mostly on "what's now", not much interest in the history, changes, looking back in time, etc. 
-  People favor exchange of information and communication rather than accurate and trustable documentation?????

Other way to interpret/analyse the data


-  How SW and IT support the daily work?
-  How SW and IT support the management?
-  How SW and IT differ, what are the "dynamics" the generate?

-  there is a need for a lightweight solution to support the synchronization issues that often exist; currently they are usually supported by repetitive manual work
-  they think that an integrated platform can help for many of the issues they encounter in their daily work, there might be a tendence to bring things together/there is a wish for synchronization and unification of the processes in order to make the daily work easier 
-  data of issue tracker is flat vs data from SW is polarized (see above)
-  Often they use paper&pen and scrum wall as a tool solution or they use Excelsheet and Scrum Wall as tool solution
-  Many of them think that tools cannot really support them in the issues they are having (e.g. communication issues in within the team, or non-agile background around the Scrum team)
-  Many of them think that Scrum does not need tools, that it might rather be against the main ideas of Scrum to use tools. They say that Scrum is about commmunication and people; not about tools. Anyways they are still using (most of them) some kind of issue tracker. This leads to the idea that there is anyways a need for a tool (maybe more from the stakeholder's side). This impression was also give by the interviews.
-  In interviews and survey: Often the non-agile context in which there is the Scrum team is seen as an issue. Many other processes are not yet adapted to iterative/agile development (e.g. requirements engineering) and this leads to issues.
-  "A fool with a tool is still a fool" - this statement was given in the interview and also appeared in the survey results. They think that Scrum can be perfectly done without computer-related tools.
-  In the survey results was given the statement "Everything important for daily work shall be visible, transparent and available for the team. " -> this corresponds to the information we received in the interviews. It conferms the themes.
-  In the question whether they would use advanced technologies we have almost 50%/50%. There might be a fear towards the use of these new technologies (?) Some of them say that mabye in future this might be used, but not now.
