#What do we want to know

-  <b>low learning curve:</b> whether and how there might be a need for more learning/knowledge transfer
-  <b>involvement:</b> whether they are more motivated to work/work better when they are involved, when they feel that the process is adapted to their needs, when they feel meaningful, when they are considered
-  <b>flexibility</b>: we want to know whether the process needs to be flexible, whether it is really important that parts of the process can be improved
-  <b>accessibility</b>: we want to know whether there is really a need for accessability, whether people want to have just one access point to get their information easily
-  <b>awareness:</b> whether people want to be aware of what their collegues are doing, whether they work better when they know what their collegues are doing
-  <b>traceability:</b> whether the elements (e.g. user stories and tasks) are trackable, whether we can see their status also in past and not only the current status, whether this is important for the developers daily work, whether that is a stakeholders/PO need
-  <b>transparency:</b>  whether all team members and stakeholders have "one truth", whether there are hidden bugs 
-  <b>reporting</b>: whether there is a need for reporting, whether reporting can work with only the scrum wall
-  <b>accuracy</b>: whether there have an issue to find actual and updated information, whether there are version issues
-  <b>integration w/ other teams</b>: whether and how they integrate with other teams, how do they share information with members from other teams



-  <b>low learning curve:</b> how much time can be allocated to learn new tools/process, whether people or what kind of people is willing to invest time and effort or not, and what is the consequence of insufficient training/learning
-  <b>involvement:</b> whether people commitment increases when the feel involved, how frequently they are willing to involve time & energy in the refinement, the various kind of feedback (construcitve/negative), and whether this involvement results in actual changes and increase productivity. 
-  <b>flexibility</b>: what aspects of the process/tools are typically changed, what are the area that requires the most flexibility, how the people learn from their mistakes.
-  <b>accessibility</b>: how people search, navigate, and locate meaningful information, how much is too much, what are the access patterns, what are the entry point to the written knowledge. 
-  <b>awareness:</b> what the member need to know about other member to be effective, whether having a global vision is good or bad, what are the places/means that people use to get aware of what's going on, what is the effect of awareness on task assignement, whether it enables certain management practices (e.g. a work is stick, another guy can take over urgent duties).
-  <b>traceability:</b> whether changes needs to tracked, and whether the history is valueable, when do people refer to older versions (e.g. to justify decision), how is the history actually used, and whether the "episodic" knowledge is important.
-  <b>transparency:</b>  whether all team members and stakeholders have "one truth", whether different people/roles get different views, what management practice works better.
-  <b>reporting</b>: whether reports are actually used, to take decision, to track progress, what kind of report works, whether they are trusted, what is the effort people are willing to spend on reporting, what is the granularity of the reports.
-  <b>accuracy</b>: whether there have an issue to find actual and updated information, whether there are version issues, whether people trust information, what is the overhead to keep information up-to-date, what is the right amount of information to keep in written form vs. in people's head.
-  <b>integration w/ other teams</b>: what information need to be shared/exchanged with other teams, what are the practices set up to collaborate seamlessly with other teams, whether teams understand each other, what is the autonomy of each teams

	- Goals and objectives. (*informal communication*)
	- Trust and conflict. (*communication/refinement*)
	- Leadership
	- Use of resources
	- Interpersonal communication (!)
	- Control and procedures. (*control -> trustable information systems*)
	- Problem solving and decision making. (*decision making -> trustable information systems*)
	- Experimentation and creativity
	- Self-evaluation. (*refinement*)
	- Roles, responsibility, and authority.


#Current theory in progress
Factors that tend to make Scrum more agile, and hence successful, are involvement, flexibility, accessibility, awareness and transparency. 
The Scrum wall is therefore essential to the success of Scrum due to its informal, interactive and communication improving nature. The decision need however to be stored in an issue tracker or other computer-related tool for management and reporting reasons. The overhead of synchronization is an issue that could be improved by lightweight solutions.

#Some notes about Grounded Theory

-  Goal: develop a theory that is close to reality and applicable to praxis
-  Not subjective views but social phenomena
-  At the beginning: no theory/hypothesis, just the examination area
-  The theory is object of continuous modification/adaption
-  individual cases enrich the theory
-  theoretical Coding: e.g. "Persons reads the manual for the video player" -> GT: "information retrieval" or When I have arthritic pain, I take Aspirin. After a while I feel better“ -> GT: "Condition: have, phenomen: arthritic pain, strategy: Aspirin, Consequence: feel better."
- "Gütekriterien für eine gute Grounded Theory Studie sind: <br />1. Angemessenheit, d.h., die Theorie sollte dem realen Leben entsprechen<br />2. Verständlichkeit, d.h. sie sollte für Informanten und professionell Tätige verständlich und nachvollziehbarsein <br />3. Generalisierbarkeit, d.h. die sollte in einer Vielzahl von "Settings"und Kontexten anwendbar sein<br />4. Überprüfbarkeit, d.h. man soll nachvollziehen können, dass die Theorie wirklich aus den Daten gebildet wurden. "<br />
