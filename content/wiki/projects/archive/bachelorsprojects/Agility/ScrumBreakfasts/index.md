#Scrum Breakfasts
**29. September 2010:** [http://www.swissict.ch/breakfast_be_sept10.html](http://www.swissict.ch/breakfast_be_sept10.html)
Some notes: 

-  Experience: developers do a good pair programming because they do not like bugfixing (they know about efficiency of pair programming)
-  Daily Scrum Meeting: If someone comes late, he must put 2CHF in a piggy-bank, at the end they had more than 100 CHF collected for a team activity
-  Diagrams: get it easier (no "rocket science")
