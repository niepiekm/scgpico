Title: Scripting Smalltalk
---

Smalltalk has a lot of properties that would make it interesting as a scripting language in the spirit of Python or Ruby: The language is very simple, this easy to learn and extend.

But historically, almost all Smalltalk systems are only providing the graphical development environment, but no facilities for using a text-only syntax for writing (and running) simple scripts.

The goal of the project is to build a prototype of a smallltalk scripting language based on Squeak.
