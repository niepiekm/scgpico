Title: Google Bug Tracker Integration

#Google Bug Tracker Integration
This project aims to integrate the Bug Tracker of Google Code into the Pharo development environment. The goal would be to create new bug reports from the code browser and debugger, as well as the possibility to assign bugs to commits and automatically close them.

The project includes the implementation of a flexible and extensible object model to track and manipulate the issues on Google Code. Possible customers include the Pharo, Seaside, Magritte and Pier Development Teams.
