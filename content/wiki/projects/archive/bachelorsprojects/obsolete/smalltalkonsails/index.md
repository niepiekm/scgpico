Title: Smalltalk on Sails
---

As an April Fool's joke Wilkes Joiner [submitted](http://lists.squeakfoundation.org/pipermail/seaside/2006-March/007089.html) a [screen-cast](http://wilkesjoiner.com/sos.mov) of a [Ruby on Rails](http://www.rubyonrails.org) like Web application framework built in [Squeak](http://www.squeak.org) using [Seaside](http://www.seaside.st). The goal of this project is to make developing applications in [Seaside](http://www.seaside.st) much easier and more appealing for beginners and people coming from other programming languages. As a start a similar approach to [Ruby on Rails](http://www.rubyonrails.org) should be followed, taking the initial idea of Wilkes Joiner and the advantages of existing frameworks such as [Seaside](http://www.seaside.st) (Web application framework), [Magritte](http://www.lukas-renggli.ch/smalltalk/magritte) (dynamic meta-model) and object databases.
