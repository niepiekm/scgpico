Title: Squeak Test Server ServeUnit
---

[Squeak](http://www.squeak.org) is an open-source effort to produce the dynabook of the 21 century.
Its current version comes with around 1300 unit tests, some of them broken.
The goal of this project would be to enhance an existing TestServer using [Seaside](http://www.seaside.st/), a modern webserver.
The base functionality of ServeUnit would be to 

-  take a fresh new image from the web
-  load the newest updates of the fine people of the squeak community
-  runs all existing tests
-  display them using Seaside
