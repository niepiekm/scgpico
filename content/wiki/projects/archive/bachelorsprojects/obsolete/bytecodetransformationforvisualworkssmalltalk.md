Title: Bytecode Transformation for VisualWorks Smalltalk

#Bytecode Transformation for VisualWorks Smalltalk
ByteSurgeon is a library to transform binary code in Smalltalk. It takes full advantage of the flexibility of the Squeak environment to enable bytecode transformation at runtime, thereby allowing dynamic, on-the-fly modification of applications. ByteSurgeon operates on bytecode in order to cope with situation where either the source code or a full compiler is not available, while providing appropriate high-level abstractions so that users do not need to program at the bytecode level. (see [ByteSurgeon](%base_url%/research/bytesurgeon))

But ByteSurgeon is only availabe for Squeak Smalltalk. The goal of this project is to port ByteSurgeon to VisualWorks Smalltalk.
