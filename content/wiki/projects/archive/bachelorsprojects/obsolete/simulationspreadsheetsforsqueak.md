#Simulation Spreadsheets for Squeak
The goal of this project is build a spreadsheet framework for Squeak/Tweak,
where each cells knows about its neighbors and is programmable by an end-user like EToys.

Several simple applications using matrices/cellular automatons should be built first, 
the framework would emerge on the way.
The following is an uncomplete list of applications, which finally should be easy to script for an end-user within Squeak:

-  Game of Life
-  New Kind Of Science Cellular Automatons
-  Computation of Mars Surface Energy Transfer
-  ...
