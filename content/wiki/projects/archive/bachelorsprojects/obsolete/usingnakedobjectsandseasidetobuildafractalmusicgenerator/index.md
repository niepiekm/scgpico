Title: Using Naked Objects and Seaside to build a Fractal Music Generator
---

[Musinum](http://www.reglos.de/musinum/) is a fascinating generator of fractal "music" and is [build with VisualBasic](http://www.reglos.de/musinum/musinum2.gif) and thus not platform-independent. Here a [nice, baroquesk example](http://www.reglos.de/musinum/midi/bark1.mid) and some other [tunes](http://reglos.de/musinum/examples.html).

[Maui](http://minnow.cc.gatech.edu/squeak/3836) is a lighweight implementation of the [Naked Objects](http://www.nakedobjects.org) Framework. (See also [the book on naked objects online](http://www.nakedobjects.org/static.php?content=content.html))
[Seaside](http://www.seaside.st/) is a 21 century web-application server.

The goals of the project is to port Musinum to Squeak using the existing [core implementation](http://map1.squeakfoundation.org/sm/package/8f5ae111-3b55-433e-8a4b-0a34c3852076), both as a standalone program with the paradigm of naked objects and as a web-server program with seaside.
We would also require

-  reading in existing ["scores"](http://reglos.de/musinum/examples.html)
-  creating midi-files and score-files
-  a small experience report on using naked objects/Maui
-  a small experience report on using Seaside 
Besides building a funky application you would learn about

-  Squeak
-  Smalltalk
-  Naked Objects
-  Seaside
-  Writing

(Project reserved until July)
