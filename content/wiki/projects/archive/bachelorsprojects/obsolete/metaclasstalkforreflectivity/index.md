Title: MetaclassTalk for Reflectivity
---

[MetaclassTalk](http://csl.ensm-douai.fr/MetaclassTalk) is a reflective extension of Smalltalk that provides programmers with a a meta-object protocol (MOP) to control object behavior (message sends and receptions and method lookup and application). It aims easing experiments of new concepts, programming pradigms and langage extensions.

Reflectivity (see [http://scg.unibe.ch](%base_url%/)) provides with Geppetto an interesting infrastructure to implement the MetaclassTalk model. The goal of this project is to compare the MOP models of MetaclassTalk with the Geppetto model of partial behavioral reflection and then implement MetaclassTalk on top of Geppetto.
