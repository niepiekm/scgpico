Title: Squeak Refactoring Browser
---

The goal of this Bachelors Project is to improve the Refactoring Engine of Squeak. Smalltalk's refactoring Browser was the first refactoring tool, but it has not been developed for some years.

Possible things to work on are:


-  Add support for RoelTyper type inference engine
-  Improve the User Interface (e.g. add support for previews)
-  Add new refactorings
-  Add support for Traits
-  Replace the RBParser with the NewCompiler Parser
