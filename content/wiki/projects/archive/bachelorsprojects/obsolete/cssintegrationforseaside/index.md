Title: CSS Integration for Seaside
---

Seaside is a sophisticated and industrial strength Web application framework with objects from top to bottom. It is lacking however an object-oriented integration of [Cascading Style Sheets](http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/), right now the style specifications are just plain strings.

The goal of this project is to build an object model of CSS so that style-sheets can be generated, reflected and inspected in an object oriented manner. Moreover a meta-model should (such as an implementation of the CSS specifications) be provided to describe the assembly and the contraints of CSS rules and properties, so that a convenient Web based editor can be build. The resulting tool can be built around Web 2.0 technologies such as [AJAX](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AJAX) and [Comet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_%28programming%29).
