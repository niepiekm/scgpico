#Continuous Integration for VisualWorks
Continuous Integration is the process of continuous building, testing and reporting.

This project would imply building a Continuous Integration tool for VisualWorks. The basic requirements would be:

-  run the tests
-  create a test report
-  provide a generic mechanism for other report tools to be hooked in

The report would be done using [Seaside](http://seaside.st/). Seaside is a framework for developing sophisticated web applications in Smalltalk.
