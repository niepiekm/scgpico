Title: Wiretap for Squeak
---

Wiretap is a fancy seaside gui that enables a user to switch on and off instrumentation of an application at runtime.
The idea is based on the Java Wiretap project of Julien Fierz [http://www.iam.unibe.ch/~scg/Archive/Projects/Fier07a.pdf](http://www.iam.unibe.ch/~scg/Archive/Projects/Fier07a.pdf) (contact [Orla Greevy](greevy@iam.unibe.ch)). 
The GUI provides the following features:

-  a browser like interface to display the categories, classes, the methods or submethod elements that should be instrumented.
-  Selection of the required elements to be included in the instrumentation.
-  a trigger to mark a feature in the system using annotations (of Marcus Denker)
-  a trigger to export the instrumented information as an mse file for Moose analysis
-  Dynamic information to show that instrumenting is active/inactive


-  and lots more, if you want....

The application should also use css to improve the appearance.
