Title: MooTools Integration for Seaside

#MooTools Integration for Seaside
Seaside is a sophisticated and industrial strength Web application framework with objects from top to bottom. It currently integrates [Prototype](http://www.prototypejs.org/) and [script.aculo.us](http://script.aculo.us/) as JavaScript libraries to provide AJAX functionality. 

The goal of this project is to integrate Seaside with [MooTools](http://mootools.net/). MooTools is a compact, modular, Object-Oriented javascript framework designed to make writing extensible and compatible code easier and faster. MooTools lets you get the job done efficiently and effectively. An fully automatic transformation of Smalltalk to JavaScript code should be part of the integration.
