#A Morphology mining tool for extracting features from user interfaces
We need a tool that extracts the starting points of an application from a user interface. These starting points represent user actions which can initiate the
execution of scenarios and features.

The tool can detect and categorize gui elements as menu, button, form.  
Dependencies are also identified - eg. "After login, the following options appear:"

The output of the tool should be suitable to generate an automatic gui driver tool for feature extraction.
