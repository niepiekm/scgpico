Title: SqueakSource
---

[SqueakSource](http://www.squeaksource.com) is a successful online code repository for [Squeak](http://www.squeak.org) and [Monticello](http://www.wiresong.ca/Monticello/), similar to [SourceForge](http://www.sourceforge.net). SqueakSource has currently more than 500 registered users, 400 active projects and about 1 GB of compressed and versioned Smalltalk source code. The system became much more successful than it was designed for, the current implementation shows performance and scalability problems.

The goal of this Bachelor Project is to extend SqueakSource:


-  Provide a state-of-the-art Web 2.0 application to manage users, groups and projects.
-  Provide an object model to store, manage and search versions and source code.
-  Provide an efficient communication protocol between the server and the client.
