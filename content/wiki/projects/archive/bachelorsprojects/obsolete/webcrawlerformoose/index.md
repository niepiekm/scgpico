#Webcrawler for Moose
This project aims to build a Webcrawler in VisualWorks Smalltalk. The crawler will be used as injector for Moose, that is to import structured data from websites into Moose. For example related music on last.fm, or related books from amazon, or social networks from sites like myspaces, as in [http://www.visualcomplexity.com/vc/project.cfm?id=367](http://www.visualcomplexity.com/vc/project.cfm?id=367).
