Title: AJAX for Pier and Magritte
---

[Pier](http://www.lukas-renggli.ch/smalltalk/pier) is a powerful and extensible implementation of a meta-described content management and Wiki system, written with objects from top to bottom. It currently makes only little use of Web 2.0 technologies and forces editors to learn the wiki syntax to author pages.

The goal of this project is to create a fully AJAX based user-interface using modern Web technologies such as:


-  AJAX
-  Comet
-  Drag & Drop
-  Effects
-  In-Place editing

This projects involves Smalltalk, Seaside and JavaScript programming.
