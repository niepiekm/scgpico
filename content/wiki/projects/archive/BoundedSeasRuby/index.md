Title: Parsing Ruby with Bounded Seas
---
#Parsing Ruby with Bounded Seas
Ruby language is exceptionally hard to parse. [Bounded Seas](%base_url%/scgbib?_k=xMbjghUa&query=Kurs14b) is a technique for semi-parsing. Its goal is to simplify development of parsers by skipping some parts of a grammar.

In this project we test ability of bounded seas to describe a Ruby grammar and extract important information such as classes, methods and method calls.
