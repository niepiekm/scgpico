Title: Plugin for Moose to Analyse Natural Language Questions
---

[Moose](http://www.moosetechnology.org/) is a Pharo based platform for software and data analysis. It helps programmers to perform custom analyses. When a user is new to the Moose environment, it may be difficult for the user to know how to make the best use of Moose to solve a problem. To get aware of the queries that can be performed on Moose and syntax of queries takes time.  

The aim of this project is to develop a plugin for the Moose platform where a user can interact in natural language (English), in order to ease an analysis in Moose.  



#Your task will consist of :


-  Evaluation of the-state-of-the-art of NLP in Pharo.
-  Perform preprocessing of the sentence given by the user.
-  Execute basic queries.
