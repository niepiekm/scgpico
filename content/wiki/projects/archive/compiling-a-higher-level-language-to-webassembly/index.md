Title: Compiling a higher-level language to WebAssembly
---

#Project Idea

<div align="justify">

[WebAssembly](http://webassembly.org/) is a relatively new assembly language that aims at providing near-native performance for the web.
The standard is independent of an in-browser runtime, there exists a runtime on NodeJS and a C-to-WebAssembly compiler as well.
The goal of this project is to explore and build a compiler pipeline for a higher-level language (COOL, MiniJava, ...), targeting WebAssembly.
You will explore parser generators, IRs, and the WebAssembly specification.
