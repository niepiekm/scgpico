Title: For Example JUnit
---

After [reporting a bug and some discussion with JUnit's maintainers](https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&atid=115278&aid=1703148&group_id=15278), David Saff showed interest in test-examples for JUnit. Hence, the idea of this project is to write a proof-of-concept prototype that extends JUnit 4.0 with an example-based dependency mechanism. 

Background: in his PhD, Markus GÃ¤lli analysed the code coverage of tests and found that they do not each cover different parts of the code, instead he discovered that the coverages form a partial order. Thus he concluded that tests could be refactored into a hierarchy of tests, where many tests use the return value of one other test as input. He calls the tests in such a hierarchy examples, ie the examples <i>are</i> the tests. The avantage of such a testing framework would be, that it is aware of dependencies between tests and could thus, in case of an error, much more precisely point to the source.
