Title: Polyglot development using GraalVM - Memgen
---

The aim of this project is to implement a Meme Generator web app (something like [http://www.memegen.com/](http://www.memegen.com/)) using the polyglot capabilities of the GraalVM i.e. using multiple programming languages in the implementation of a single application.

GraalVM is a research VM from Oracle Labs. One distinguishing feature of GraalVM is it's Polyglot support - the ability to execute code written in several different languages (Java, JavaScript/Node.js, Ruby, R, C/C\+\+) and have this code seamlessly inter-operate (e.g. Call functions from one language to another, share data between languages without serialization) without a performance penalty.

This project will be supervised by [Boris SpasojeviÄ‡](%base_url%/staff/Boris-Spasojevic) from Oracle Labs Zurich.
