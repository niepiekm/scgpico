#Polyglot development using GraalVM - Twitter analysis
The aim of this project is to write a polyglot application using the capabilities and languages of GraalVM. GraalVM is a research VM from Oracle Labs. One distinguishing feature of GraalVM is it's Polyglot support - the ability to execute code written in several different languages (Java, JavaScript/Node.js, Ruby, R, C/C\+\+) and have this code seamlessly inter-operate (e.g. Call functions from one language to another, share data between languages without serialization) without a performance penalty.

The application itself should, for example, use Java to obtain all tweets with a particular hashtag, use R to analyze to content of those tweets in a meaningful manner and use Node.js to provide a HTML based GUI for the app.

This project will be supervised by [Boris SpasojeviÄ‡](%base_url%/staff/Boris-Spasojevic) from Oracle Labs Zurich.
