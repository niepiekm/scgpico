Title: HIKOMSYS
---

<span style="color: green;">**New team member needed!**</span> We are looking for a bachelor or masters student, who is motivated by raising developer awareness of the importance of software analysis in a playful manner. Your **goal** would be to **add new fun levels to** [HIKOMSYS](http://pinocchio.unibe.ch/hikomsys/). To prepare these levels you will have to first design the corresponding static analysis. You will have the **full support of the team** for all the phases of your project. 

**Goal**

-  develop a **fun online game** that tests developers knowledge about the architecture of their system. 
-  collect information that could support future research 
	-  on the system that the developers use already: complement system documentation, 
	-  benchmark for component detection
	-  benchmark for automatic refactoring techniques

-  possible further research questions
	-  do developers get better at the game if they play it again? one week later? one month later?

**Milestones:**

-  **Paper based game design** 
	-  what do we want to collect (dependencies between modules (reflexion models), dependencies that should not be, ranking things (deps, classes)...)
	-  game workflow design
	-  try out the manual analysis with Moose
	-  try-outs with people 




-  **Alpha version**
	-  backend 
		-  find parser for java (VerveineJ, inFusion), 
		-  glue with Moose




-  **Back-end** 
	-  populate with data
		-  which systems to choose? 
		-  which developers to contact?




-  **Front-end** 
	-  implement front-end
	-  point system / ranking



-  **Write up paper**
-  **Expand paper into thesis**





**Techologies**

-  Pharo, Moose
-  Canvas, Javascript


**Bibliography**

-  [Reflexion Models paper](http://scg.unibe.ch/scgbib?query=Murp95a&display=abstract)
