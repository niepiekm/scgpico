Title: PolyCyclomatic Complexity 
---

Cyclomatic complexity is the metric, defined in 1976. by Thomas J. McCabe, to calculate the number of linearly independent execution paths through source code. Being developed for procedural languages, it doesn't take into account polymorphic method call-sites in object-oriented programming languages.

The aim of this project is to calculate the number of linearly independent execution paths through OO source code, based on all possible method executions, due to the polymorphism.
