Title: Enhancing the User Experience in a Live Coding Environment
---

GT â the [Glamorous Toolkit](https://gtoolkit.com) âÂ is a "moldable", live development environment for Pharo Smalltalk.
The environment can be easily adapted to support live development in a variety of application domains.

The goal of this project would be to explore one of several directions that would enhance the user experience within GT.
Possible directions include:

1. **Developing a live tutorial.**
GT includes tools to build interactive slideshows, monitoring of task completion, and explanatory links between documentation and live coding tools.
The goal of this sub-project would be to transform an existing static tutorial into a live one that guides and monitors the student's progress.

2. **Implementing advanced graph layouts.**
For the algorithmically-inclined, this sub-project would focus on developing new or improved layouts for the existing graphical infrastructure.
An example would be better force-based layouts that yield more aesthetically pleasing results that the existing, naive algorithm.

3. **Code bubbles for GT.**
GT has some basic infrastructure for programmatically building graphs of code snippets.
This sub-project would focus on providing a better user experience for interactively creating graphs of "code bubbles", and sharing them with other users.
