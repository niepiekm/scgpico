Title: Injecting Javascript into Android apps

#Injecting Javascript into Android apps
Android WebView is a system component powered by Chrome that allows Android apps to display web content. Adversaries may successfully inject Javascript into this component via various channels.

In this project we would look for such a vulnerability in various real world apps on the market, exploit it, and study if the exploits are similar.
