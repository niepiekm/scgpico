#SVC: The Software Visualization Corpus
#Abstract

There is limited evidence of the effectiveness of software visualization tools. One reason is that researchers in the field struggle to find suitable related tools to compare a new proposed approach. To alleviate this problem, in this project we will systematically collect proposed software visualization tools which are referenced in the literature, and will classify them by characteristics such as the supported tasks, data, the running environment, and type of license. As an output of the project we will build the SVC, a curated corpus of selected open source software visualization tools publicly available. We expect that researchers in the field use SVC to:


-  Identify and run software visualization tools for evaluations, and
-  Analyze the characteristics of proposed tools for design.
