Title: Crypto libraries on Stack Overflow
---

Previous studies have shown that cryptography is considered difficult for developers to use. This is due to several reasons. For instance, developers should be aware of complicated concepts or need to choose the right option or algorithm among many choices.

This seminar project aims to extract questions and answers concerning crypto libraries in various languages from Stack Overflow.
More specifically, we are interested in understanding the common problems in similar crypto APIs in different crypto libraries.
