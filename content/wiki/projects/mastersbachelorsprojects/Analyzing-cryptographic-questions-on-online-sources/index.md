Title: Analysing cryptographic questions on online sources
---

Cryptographic algorithms massively depend on mathematics and computer science. The cryptographic algorithms are designed in a way that breaking them is considered a hard task by adversaries. However, not all developers are familiar with cryptographic concepts and algorithms. As a result, they ask their uncertainties on online sources such as Stack Overflow and Crypto StackExchange. 
Provided answers by the aforementioned communities are varied in terms of quality and correctness. <br>
This seminar project aims to extract questions and answers concerning cryptography-related questions from the two online sources (Stack Overflow and Crypto StackExchange), and store them in a relational database. Ultimately, we are interested to analyze the mined data to investigate the topics covered by cryptographic-related questions, the most popular ones, and the most difficult ones to answer.
