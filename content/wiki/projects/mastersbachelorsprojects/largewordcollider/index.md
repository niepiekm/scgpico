**Inspired from the LHC, the LWC will accelerate word particles at learners.**

#Context
[zeeguu](https://www.zeeguu.org) aims at completely revolutionizing the way a user acquires the vocabulary of a new language. 

Zeeguu keeps track of all the words a user is learning in an online profile and provides an API for accessing it. Since the transfer to long term memory of a new word is only achieved after seven or more repetitions, this project aims at increasing the userâs exposure to the new words he is learning, while browsing the web. 

#Goal
The goal of The Large Word Collider project is to design and build a browser extension which will provide for the user an increased exposure to the words that he is learning. Some ways in which you could do this are: 

-  highlighting the words that are being learned in the web pages that the user is visiting 
-  the extension automatically crawls the links from the current page and estimates **the difficulty** of each one by taking into account the words that are scheduled for rehearsal, as well as the words that the user knows.

#What you will learn and practice

-  Developing Google Chrome extensions, which have an [excellent architecture](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/index)
-  Basic [natural language processing](http://norvig.com/ngrams/) algorithms
-  [Good team-work](http://losingit65.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/nerd-party.png) since the project involves you working with the Zeeguu team

#Requirements

-  Love for coding
-  [Ideally] Medium level expertise in a foreign language so you can use project yourself
