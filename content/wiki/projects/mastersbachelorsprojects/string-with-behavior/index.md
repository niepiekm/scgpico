#Introduction
Wherever sensitive information is around the String class is not far away.
For example, user names and passwords, hashes, secrets, and email addresses are commonly stored in string variables.

#Problem
Unfortunately, the protection of String is not a trivial task and many different approaches have been proposed by academia and implemented in industry.

#Task
In this work we want to explore the gains offered by a flexible String API that allows developers to attach behavior to certain String instances.
<br>
Your task will consist of:

-  Getting familiar with OpenJDK source code
-  Extending the existing String class
-  Evaluating the custom String class with existing applications
