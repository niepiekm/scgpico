Title: Analyzing UML model evolution within software projects

#Analyzing UML model evolution within software projects
In this seminar project, you will analyze a dataset of software projects which has UML diagrams (e.g. [https://www.gu.se/english/research/publication/?publicationId=256828](https://www.gu.se/english/research/publication/?publicationId=256828)) used for the modeling purpose. You will make inferences about the UML model evolution within the project, whether they are updated frequently and reflect the true state of the project, which diagrams are used etc.

What you will learn in this project-

- Finding/ mining/ preparing a dataset and to extract important features of the data
- Using Pharo to visualize and summarize the relationships and make inferences about the evolution of the UML diagrams/models and their relevance
