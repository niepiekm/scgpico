Title: Sublime/Atom Plugin for Smalltalk Autocomplete
---

Polite Smalltalk is a research language developed at the University of Bern. 

Normally we write Polite code in the Smalltalk IDE, but if we would want to write it in one of the classical text editors for OS X, such as Sublime or more recently Atom, we would need a smart auto-completion plugin.

The plugin should take into account information about method frequency from the EATI server hosted at the University of Bern. 

This is a research project that fits somebody interested in programming language design and advanced developer tools development.
