Title: Lightweight Visualization Engine for Unity

#Lightweight Visualization Engine for Unity
#Problem
In a recent study, we developed [CityVR](%base_url%/research/cityvr), an immersive 3D software city visualization, in Unity. We used Unity because of its capabilities to provide (1) end-users highly interactive applications, and (2) developers deployment options among several modern devices such as immersive 3D devices (HTC Vive, Oculus Rift). However, we found that Unity, which mostly targets game applications, lacks an abstraction layer to build software/data visualizations.      

#Approach
In this project we will develop such support, and so provide developers an API to build visualizations. Firstly, we will implement a few of basic elements such as shapes, and layouts. Then, we will define a few visualizations to port to Unity.
