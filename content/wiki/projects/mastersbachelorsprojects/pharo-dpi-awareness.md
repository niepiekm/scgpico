Title: DPI-awareness in Pharo

#DPI-awareness in Pharo
#Project Idea
Due to the rise of high-resolution displays in recent years, user interfaces
that use fixed pixel-sizes for drawing certain elements tend to become too
small to read. While operating systems can scale them up to some degree, the
results are often blurry. Instead, programmers should write code that does not
rely on fixed sizes, but instead draw elements depending on the DPI values of
the current screen in order to ensure readable interfaces on every display.

Pharo is currently not DPI aware. The goal of this project is to change this
and add proper support for high-resolution displays to Pharo. This project may
include both work on the Pharo virtual machine and within the image.

This project is intended as a seminar or bachelor thesis project.
