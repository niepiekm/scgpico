#The myth of test coverage
Test coverage is the amount of testing performed on a software program. With increase in the coverage we often expect decrease in the bugs in a program, and therefore, this measure is often an indicator of the program quality.


There are various metrics to compute (structural) test coverage e.g., statement coverage, branch coverage, etc. In this seminar project we plan to identify the state-of-the-art metrics and study the pros and cons of each.
