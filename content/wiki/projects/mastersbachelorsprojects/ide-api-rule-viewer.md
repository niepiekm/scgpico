#IDE plugin for viewing API usage rules
API usage rules are constraints on how one should use an API. For example, a simple rule could be that whenever a file is opened (open()), it should eventually be closed at a later time (close()). Approaches to obtain such rules exist in many ways, however, they have in common that rules are hard to read manually; there is no interface for viewing usage rules.

In this seminar project, you will implement a viewer for existing usage rule formats as a plugin for the IntelliJ IDEA / Android Studio IDE. In particular, your tasks include:


- Familiarise yourself with Android Studio
- Review existing rule formats, choose a suitable format and characteristics
- Implement rule viewer
