Title: Immersive 3D Collaborative Software Visualization

#Immersive 3D Collaborative Software Visualization
#Problem
Many software visualizations have proven helpful to alleviate particular needs of developers by including visualization techniques in a 3D space. In a previous study, we found that the immersive 3D environment (I3D) medium (e.g., HTC Vive, Oculus Rift) provides users the best recollection, and good performance and user experience. However, the frameworks used to build visualizations in I3D lack support for collaborative visualization. That is, to allow users to interact with each other in real time while visualizing a software system.

#Approach
In this project we will develop such support for the Unity3D engine. Our prototype will allow remote users of a same application to see and interact with each other in the virtual world.
