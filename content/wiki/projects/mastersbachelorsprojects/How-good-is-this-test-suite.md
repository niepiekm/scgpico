#Project Idea

<div align="justify">

Maintaining unit test cases is important during software development lifecycle. Research has shown unit test cases are usually named improperly that impede developers understanding while studying test cases.

In object-oriented programs the main functionality (object behavior) is typically exposed through mutator methods that manipulate the object state. Our earlier research has shown that such methods, called F-MUTs, within a unit test case represent the actual intent(s) of a unit test case, while other methods are ancillary and provide required data for this purpose.

In this project we would study several unit tested software systems and investigate whether the knowledge of F-MUTs can facilitate naming uni test cases in an automatic manner.
