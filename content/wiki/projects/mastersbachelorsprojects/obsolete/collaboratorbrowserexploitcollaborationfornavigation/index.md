Title: CollaboratorBrowser - Exploit collaboration for navigation
---

Identifying how static source artifacts (classes, methods) collaborate with each other at runtime is a difficult task. Development environments provide little to ease this task. In Smalltalk we have a functionality showing us all senders (ie, invoking methods) of a selector, but this information is collected statically, eg. a #children method will most likely have many senders, most of them having nothing to do with the concrete children method we are looking at. We envision a browser that uses the information of collaboration we have (can be based on static means at the beginning) as a fully integrated tool to navigate source code. When we for instance select a method of a class, we always want to see all its senders, grouped by local (from the same class) and remote senders (from other classes), maybe also grouped by senders from inside or outside the same package. For classes, we similarly want to get a list of classes grouped by inside or outside the same package that are sending messages to instances of this class. At a later stage we could also exploit available dynamic information to filter or sort these lists of collaborating entities according to what has actually been executed at runtime. 
The primary goal of this project is to enhance the navigation of the space by ubiquitous availabilty of collaboration information and by using this information as a first-class means for navigation, besides and orthogonally to the navigation by means of the static structure of a system (package -> class ->  method). 

We face several challenges in this project:

-  How to display, arrange the information about collaboration orthogonally to the static structure, how to exploit it for easy navigation?
-  How to gather and aggregate the information efficiencly in order to provide it immediately and ubiquitously to the developer? Even we just use static information, it takes time to compute static senders of a method for instance.
-  Identifying and experimenting with different means to determine collaboration that the sender information: We could experiment with determing collaboration by means of variable references, eg. which variables of which class or method reference which other classes? Or we could also use implementors information (which class implements a selector used in a method) to assess collaboration. How do we combine these various means to assess collaboration, how do we present the information to the developer?

These questions are to be exploited in this project. We suggest to use the Squeak/Pharo IDE as a case study and prototype for this work as we have already built up infrastructure there. Doing the project in Eclipse is also possible though.
