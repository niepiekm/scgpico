#Language Boxes
[Language Boxes](%base_url%/research/helvetia/languageboxes) are language changes as a first-class entities that bend the syntax and semantics of the host language. There is a prototypical implementation for a dynamically typed programming language. 

Different master projects around this topic are possible:


-  How the language box model can be applied to statically typed langauges such as Java, C#, or Haskel what the problems are in this context, and how they can be solved.
-  How can the language box model be applied to user interfaces, so that for example the GUI changes depending on the context of the language.
