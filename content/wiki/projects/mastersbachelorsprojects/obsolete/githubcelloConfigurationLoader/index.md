Title: GitHubcello Configuration Loader
---
#GitHubcello Configuration Loader
#Project Idea

For years [Pharo](http://pharo.org) developers were using Monticello versioning system and Metacello configuration manager. But nowadays more and more developers switch to git which makes versioning mush easier. However it's still complicated to load a project because of Metacello configurations burden. The goal of this project is to provide developers with tool to easily load a project if they know a GitHub url, username, etc...

#Challenges


-  identify if given GitHub project has a Metacello configuration and how to load it
-  provide a dead-simple interface for loading projects
-  mine github to find existing projects


This project is on the level of seminar/bachelor
