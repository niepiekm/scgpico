Title: Using Feature Analysis to reverse engineer Software Architectures
---

Software Architectures provide structure to many of today's industrial and open source applications. Typically an architecture is defined and the software developer builds software in accordance to the architectural structure. 

Two typical situations can arise:


-  Typically during the development and maintenance cycle, the architectural rules may be violated. 


-  A software house needs to prove that the software system adheres to an architecture, so that he can provide a stamp of quality for the software.
 
We would like to use feature analysis to mine architectural patterns or detect architectural violations.
