Title: Markov chain visualisation
---

I've developed a simple framework in Pharo Smalltalk that enables easy simulations using markov chain models. Markov chains are, roughly, directed graphs where each edge has a transition probability. So, given a current state, the next one is automatically determined randomly and according to the given probabilities. Visualising the markov chain graph and the state transitions would make following a markov chain simulation much more intuitive.
