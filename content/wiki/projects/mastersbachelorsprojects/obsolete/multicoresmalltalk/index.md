Title: Multi Core Smalltalk
---

Most todays Smalltalk only support [green threads](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multithreading), meaning the VM only uses one CPU. The goal of this project is to make multiple CPUs available to Squeak and allow a transparent and efficient usage of multiple cores. The master project will include low-level VM hacking and high-level library work on the Smalltalk level.
