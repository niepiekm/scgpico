Title: Reverse engineering and visualizing Feature Models
---

Feature modeling bridges the gap between requirements engineering and design. It provides a means of expressing the functionalities of a system from the perspective of different stakeholders of a system. The features are modeled in a hierarchy that expresses clearly defined relationships (described in FODA).

Our goal is to apply a feature location approach to extract features and define relationships and model the relationships using the mondrian visualization tool.
