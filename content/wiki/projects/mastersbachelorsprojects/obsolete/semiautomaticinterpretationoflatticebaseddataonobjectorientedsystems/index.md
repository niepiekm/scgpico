Title: SemiAutomatic Interpretation of Lattice-Based Data on Object Oriented Systems
---

ConAn is a framework developed in the SCG during last 4 years. It helps the developer to work with Formal Concept Analysis (a clustering technique) and discover different high-level views on object-oriented systems.

The different high-level views are based on schemas and patterns identified in the lattice and stored in a catalog for further analysis. So far the catalog is built manually.

The goal of this master project is a framework of (semi) automatic interpretation of data extracted from lattices to increment our catalog of schemas or patterns.
