Title: Omniscient Debugger
---

Memory has gotten cheap. Even a laptop nowadays has more than a gig of ram... so let's try to find a way to use that.
One idea: [The Omniscient Debugging](http://www.lambdacs.com/debugger/debugger.html):

"What if your debugger could go "go backwards in time?" Would that make debugging easier? By simply recording all variable assignments, it is possible to do essentially this. This is the underlying idea for omniscient debugging. The amazing part is that significantly large programs can be debugged in this fashion &mdash; Ant, JUnit, the debugger itself."

The goal of this thesis would be to extend the Squeak Debugger with the idea of Omniscent Debugging.
