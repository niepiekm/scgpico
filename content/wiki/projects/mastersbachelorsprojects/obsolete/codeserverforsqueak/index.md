#Code  server for Squeak
The topic of this master is to develop a server of code for Squeak. The idea is to be able to 

-  publish code
-  query all the code since the beginning of squeak. 

Keywords: code meta-model, versioning, code management, slice, history

Context: Squeak's 10th birthday was on 1.10.2006. A lot of things changed in 10 years... all these developments have been done under the Squeak License. Now Version 1.1 has been re-released under the Apache License. 

The goal of this Master Project is to develope a server based service that has the complete history of Squeak available. This then can be queried  by different tools, from the normal Squeak history facilities to new analysis tools. 

As part of the project, one such analysis tools should be developed for analyszing code ownership for helping with the re-licensing of Squeak.
