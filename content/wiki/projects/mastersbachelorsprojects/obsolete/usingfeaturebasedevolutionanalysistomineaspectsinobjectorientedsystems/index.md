Title: Using Feature-based Evolution Analysis to mine aspects in Object Oriented Systems
---

Aspect mining approaches focus on techniques such as fan-in analysis, concept analysis and clone detection.
Anaylsis of additions to features is ideal way to detect the addition of cross-cutting concerns in an application.
A feature-evolution approach combines dynamic analysis and historical analysis approaches to reverse engineering.

Aspect mining is receiving a lot of attention in the research community. A reference case study JHotdraw has been defined.
