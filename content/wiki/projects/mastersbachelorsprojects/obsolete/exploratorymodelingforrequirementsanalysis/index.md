#Exploratory Modeling for Requirements Analysis
Generally the process of collecting requirements for a software project involves communicating with the customer to understand, gather, document his/her requirements. This usually involves producing documentation which is reviewed by the customer on the one side and the technical team (architect, software engineers) on the other side. One of the main difficulties is that the customer cannot completely express requirements for a non-existent system and often only really becomes aware of what is necessary when using the application. Another problem is  that the process of requirements collection is too static.  With this project I would like to build a system which would support exploratory modelling with the customer. The requirements analyst would be able to quickly put together and model the users requirements and provide a means where the user can verify his requirements by executing them.
