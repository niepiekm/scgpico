Title: Spatial Package Layout
---

Package are usually presented as a tree sorted alphabetically.

However, in most system following a layered design, high-level package are used to identify the layers. 

We suspect that packages could be shown on a 2D space as rectangle for a more natural navigation (it matches closer the mental model of the system) and to capture architectural constraints at the same time.

Goal of the project is to explore this navigation

-  implement prototype
-  see if project can be represented with such layout and the number of architectural violations
-  validate/invalidate the usefulness of the navigation
