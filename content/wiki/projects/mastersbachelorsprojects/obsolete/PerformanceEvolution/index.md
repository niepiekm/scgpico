Title: Performance Evolution Analysis
---

#Project Idea
Analyzing the evolution of performance is important to because as a software system evolves, more features are introduced, some of which may introduce a performance overhead. The idea of this project is to build a tool that measures some performance metrics on a system and analyzes the evolution of these metrics alongside the evolution of the system itself.

One way to do it is to take snapshots of the system, run the (unchanged) test cases for each snapshot, collect performance metrics, and visualize them. Snapshots can be major versions, minor versions, or custom builds after a group of related commits.

This project can be scaled down to a seminar project, or up to a master thesis, depending on the capabilities of the tool and the sophistication of the analysis.
