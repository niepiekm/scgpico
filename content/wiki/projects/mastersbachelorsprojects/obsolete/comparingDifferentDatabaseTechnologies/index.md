#Comparing Different Database Technologies
Understanding source code is important for software maintenance and evolution. The main difficulty in understanding object-oriented source code lies in polymorphism and late binding. Storing information about method calls that happen during program execution are memory and time consuming. We aim to investigate which database technology would be the most appropriate one, i.e. during program run, which database technology would give a minimal overhead.
