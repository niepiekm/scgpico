Title: Virtual Classes for Dynamic Types Languages
---

The goal of this project is to implement a virtual classes mechanism in Squeak and to compare it with the classical class extension mechanism. In Smalltalk and in Java method are virtual (i.e., sending a message trigger a lookup over class hierarchy). With Virtual classes, resolving class reference implies to look them up according to a similar way than for methods.
