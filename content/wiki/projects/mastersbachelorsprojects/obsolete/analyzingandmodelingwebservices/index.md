Title: Analyzing and Modeling Web Services
---

Applications in large organisations usually rely on integration with an existing landscape of different applications providing a variety of services. Very quickly it is difficult to get an overview of which services are availbale and which applications provide and use services. 

The goal of this project is to define a metamodel to express the relationships between applications and web services and to detect dependencies, duplications etc.

The goal is to integrate in the moose environment.
