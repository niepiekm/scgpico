#Analyzing and defining Finite state machines for feature behavior
Our feature analysis is based on extracting execution traces of features. We define a feature to be a user-triggerable action. 

The goal of this project is to analyze the behavior of a systems features in terms of finite state machines. 
A working prototype will be implemented either as an eclipse plugin, squeak plugin or moose tool to define finite state machines for features. An example tool can be found at:
