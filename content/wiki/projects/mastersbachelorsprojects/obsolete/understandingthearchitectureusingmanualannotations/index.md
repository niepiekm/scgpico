#Understanding the Architecture using Manual Annotations
In the process of understanding a system, it is important to make use of the knowledge of the developer. One thing that the developers know, or they think they know, is the overall structure of the system (i.e., the architecture). This project aims to describe this knowledge in terms of modules and relationships between these modules. The modules are mapped on the model and then the relationships are checked if they are true or not.

For example, suppose the developers tell us that we have two conceptual modules A and B and they also tell us what classes belong to which conceptual module. They also tell us that no class from module B cannot inherit from a class from module A. The system should allow for the checking the condition over the configuration.

The technical implementation is to be done on top of the Moose reengineering environment.
