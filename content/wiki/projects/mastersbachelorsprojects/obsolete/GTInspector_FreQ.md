Title: GTInspector + FreQ

#GTInspector + FreQ
The GTInspector ([http://www.humane-assessment.com/blog/glamorous-inspector-for-smalltalk/](http://www.humane-assessment.com/blog/glamorous-inspector-for-smalltalk/)) contains a 'meta' tab showing methods of the class of the inspected object. The FreQ nautilus plugin (/research/Freq) connects to a back end database that contains fresh information on the popularity of methods per class. The task at hand would be to improve the 'meta' tab of the GTInspector to also present the most frequently used methods of the class of the inspected object.
