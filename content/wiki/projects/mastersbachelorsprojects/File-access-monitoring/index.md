#File access monitoring for Android
A lot of sensitive and private information that is stored on mobile devices make these devices a good target for ransomware. In this seminar project we would record (external storage) file access information from within an app and check whether an access is legitimate. 

The ultimate goal of this project would be the use of file access information for detecting a ransomware.
