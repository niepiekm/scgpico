Network Latency issues can have great impact in some Internet protocols. Since the network data is massive a visualisation can be helpful. Network Latency Visual Analysis is proof-of-concept of that (see [Network Latency Visualisation](%assets_url%/files/b9/z75gcnv42eqwy1dwk0ttke7c1y71bt/NetworkLatency.pillar.pdf)). The POC was written in Roassal. The goal of this project is to port the Roassal implementation to the D3 library. D3 is one of the most popular visualisation engines.

Technologies: Javascript, D3, MySQL
