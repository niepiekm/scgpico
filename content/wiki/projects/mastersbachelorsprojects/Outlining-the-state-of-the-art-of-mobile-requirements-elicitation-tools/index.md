Title: Outlining the state-of-the-art of requirements elicitation tools
---

In this seminar project, first, you will do a literature survey to collect the list of tools proposed for requirements elicitation. 
Further, you will analyze those applications to reflect on their properties. This will include (but not limited to)- installing the app and listing their properties/characteristics, features, missing features, which techniques they employ, classification scheme to evaluate these apps etc. 
In the end, you will have a nice overview of the state-of-the-art elicitation tools.
