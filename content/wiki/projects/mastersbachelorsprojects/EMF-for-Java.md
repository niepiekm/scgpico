#EMF for Java
The Ecosystem monitoring framework (https://github.com/boris-spas/ecosystemMonitoringFramework) is a set of bash scripts that load a set of smalltalk projects and run a set of analysis on them. It is self contained, and runnable by executing a single script, which makes it easy to deploy it as a cron-job and and always have fresh information about the software ecosystem available.

The Idea for the projects is to port the framework to work on a set of Java projects.

Desirable knowledge: Bash, Moose, Java
