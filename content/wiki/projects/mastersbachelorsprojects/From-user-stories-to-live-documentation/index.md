#Moldable scenario builder
User stories are widely used in the industry and they are an essential building block of the sprint and scrum backlogs. Because of their compact nature and definite structure, they are easier to manage. However, they are too abstract to be a tool of communication between clients or even among developers. In this seminar project, we will take a deeper look at user stories as a tool for communication, and try to break them down into meaningful chunks such as use cases or scenarios. Further, we will demonstrate how we can specify them in Pharo, and use GT Documenter ([https://gtoolkit.com/components/](https://gtoolkit.com/components/)) to document different scenarios/ use cases specific to a user story to nicely describe it as a set of executable requirements.
