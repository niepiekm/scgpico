Title: Polymorphism Usage Idioms
---

The current research results show that at least one in five methods is polymorphic, i.e. either is overridden or is overriding a method. 

#Research questions:

-  Are most cases of polymorphism instances of the Template Method design pattern? 
-  To what extent can usages of polymorphism be classified as supporting particular idioms or design patterns? 
-  Can certain usages be considered as “best practice” and others as “code smells”?
