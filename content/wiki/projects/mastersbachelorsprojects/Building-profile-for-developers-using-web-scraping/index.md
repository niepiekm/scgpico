Title: Building profile for developers using web scraping
---

#Seminar Project
<br><p>
Building profile for developers whoÂ are on social network websites could help to get more insight about them. This can be done by scraping popular websites e.g. LinkedIn, Twitter, Stack Overflow, and GitHub. In each of the aforementioned websites, there are parts where developersâ skills, the number of questions/answers, workplace, their experience and other types of information are accessible. This seminar project aims to build a web scraper to extract information regarding developers from the aforementioned websites, store them in a relational database and provide a UI to search inside the collected data.
