#Mining StackOverflow to understand developer concerns regarding domain modelling
StackOverflow can be mined with a few keywords such as 'Domain
modelling' 'Domain models', 'UML modelling', 'Domain Driven Design'
and the results can be analysed to see which tags people use, co-relation between tags,
regarding what they have questions, any specific technology if the
mention, (if possible) identity/role of the person posting the
question etc.

With the results we could define a hypothesis such as developers
are/are not actively participating in modelling activities.
