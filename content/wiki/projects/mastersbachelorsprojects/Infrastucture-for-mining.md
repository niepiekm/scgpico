Title: Infrastructure for Mining Questions and Answers Sites

#Infrastructure for Mining Questions and Answers Sites
#Motivation
Great effort is advocated to the analysis of questions and answers sites such as stack overflow. These sites capture important concerns of software development. Mining them that can reveal insights that help for software understanding. However, a lot of effort is spent setting the data and tools up for that analysis. 

#Approach
In this project we will generate a model that can be queried for the analysis of the data through visualisation. Afterwards we can evaluate the model by visualising stack overflow data. For the analysis of data we will use Moose. Visualisations will be based on Roassal (a visualisation engine included in Moose). Both are implemented in Pharo.
