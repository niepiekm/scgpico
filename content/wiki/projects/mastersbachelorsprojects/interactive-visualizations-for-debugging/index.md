Title: Interactive visualizations for debugging
---

#This project is intended for BSc students
<br><p>
#Introduction
Visualizations such as bar charts, flow diagrams, and other illustrations are used to represent data more naturally and intuitively.

#Problem
In many implementations these visualizations work only unidirectional, i.e., the user cannot interact with them.
Therefore, to debug flow analyses a developer has in laborious work to search for the corresponding code causing the bug, instead of fixing the error straight in the visualization itself, which would then forward the changes automatically.

#State of the art
Especially in the field of data flow analysis, the tools provide only basic views of the system under test, scarcely with any possibility for user interaction.

#Task
The goal is first to select an appropriate framework that is capable of bidirectional user interactions for visualizations.
Next, supported manipulations have to be defined and implemented accordingly.
<p>
The focus of this project lies in UI implementation and elicitation engineering.

*This project could result in a joint venture with the FDN group of the University of Bern since that group acquired exhaustive knowledge in interactive visualization techniques.*

#Guiding research questions

-  Which visualization frameworks exist?
-  How many manipulations exist, and which can be implemented?
