Title: Implementing Hive Plots Layout in Roassal
---

When visualising data one of the challenges is about how to distribute the elements in the canvas (layout). There are several layouts available, each of them can be more or less useful depending on the kind of data and the task that the user need to accomplish. Hive Plots is layout useful for network data. It simplifies the way as network data is displayed allowing users to answer more visual queries.

Roassal is an agile visualisation engine. It is agile since it provide a big library of tools for quickly develop a desired visualisation. However, there is not a Hive Plots implementation in Roassal. Therefore, the goal of this project is to implement Hive Plots layout in Roassal.

Technologies: Pharo, Roassal
