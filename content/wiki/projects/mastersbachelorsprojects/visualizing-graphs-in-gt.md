Title: Visualizing Graphs in GT
---
#Visualizing Graphs in GT
In the [GlamorousToolkit](https://gtoolkit.com/), a moldable Smalltalk-based environment, several layouts for graphs already exist, e.g. a circular and a simple force-based layout.
Yet there is always room for improvement, e.g. a hierarchical layout implementation yielding unsatisfying results.
The goal of this project is to extend the existing graph layouts and their APIs in GlamorousToolkit.
A new layout algorithm could be implemented based on a scientific publication, a new force-based layout could be added, existing layouts could be improved, whole graph drawing libraries may be integrated by interfacing Smalltalk with the C library.
For inspiration, have a look at [graph drawing on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_drawing), graphviz[(homepage)](https://graphviz.org/)[(forums)](https://forum.graphviz.org/t/layout-algorithms/59), [igraph](https://igraph.org/), [tulip](https://tulip.labri.fr/TulipDrupal/), and [libcola](https://www.adaptagrams.org/documentation/libcola.html).
This project is suitable for someone interested in algorithms, Smalltalk, graphs, implementing an approach described in a scientific publication, and/or C.
