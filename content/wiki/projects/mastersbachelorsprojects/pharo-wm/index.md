Title: Pharo Window Manager
---
#Pharo Window Manager
#Project Idea
Pharo comes with a window manager that is responsible for drawing and placing
windows and their contents. Outside of Pharo, a large variety of window
managers exist that implement different styles and methodologies.

The goal of this project is to explore the possibility of alternate window
mangers for Pharo by investigating existing implementations, exploring ideas
for different ways of managing windows, and implementing such a window manager
either from scratch or on top of existing work.

This project is intended as a seminar project.
