#A web plugin to harvest the state of the art
<div align="justify">

We as researchers usually start a project by collecting what is known as the state-of-the-art in the field. This process includes searching for published papers based on a seed of keywords, inspecting each paper, and if relevant, checking the references and citations of the paper, AKA snowballing.

The aim of this project is to develop a web plugin which when installed on a browser facilitates the process of paper collection for researchers from different disciplines worldwide.

You are expected to be enthusiastic about learning how to crawl web, dirty your hands a bit with natural language processing, and develop a browser extension.

Welcome to my office for any further discussion!
