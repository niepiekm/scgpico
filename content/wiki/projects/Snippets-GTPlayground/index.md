Title: Code Snippets in GTPlayground
---

The current playground from Pharo allows users to enter one single script. In order to execute only parts of the script a user has to manually select the part of the script she is interested in. 

The goal of this project is to create a new user interface for the playground that allows users split a script into multiple independent `snippets' that can be executed and managed independently.
