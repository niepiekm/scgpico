Title: Smalltalks12 Research Track
---

Conference Location: Puerto Madryn (Argentina)

The Smalltalks series of conferences ([FAST](http://www.fast.org.ar)) is a lively forum on Smalltalk-based software technologies that brings together more than 200 people from both academia and industry for a period of three days.

Past editions of Smalltalks have included many high-quality presentations from industry and research.
These contributions have shown interesting applications of Smalltalk, advances in the Smalltalk language, didactic uses of Smalltalk and so on.

Similar to last year, [Smalltalks 2012](http://www.fast.org.ar/smalltalks2012) will include a dedicated research track.
We welcome submissions to this research track presenting original scientific contributions to, or using, Smalltalk in general.

##Submissions
