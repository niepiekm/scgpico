#Organization

The idea is to spend the morning getting to know each other and one another's work and the afternoon to work on specific research questions, possibly connected to the ones raised in the position papers, possibly about an overview of what we learned over the past 10 years, and possibly about issues raised in the morning discussions.

As some of you probably know, it is a tradition at WOOR that authors present someone elses position paper. From experience we know that this leads to a good workshop because (a) it is a good way to get acquainted with someone else's work and, (b) it helps provoking constructive discussions. This year will be no different and, below find the assignments (nothing personal in the attribution, we did try to group papers by similar topic though).

Some instructions regarding the presentations:

-  Prepare for 10 minutes presentations (and \+- 10 minutes discussion)
-  You may assume that attendees are familiar with the position papers (we will ask that attendees read all position papers before the workshop)
-  Finish the presentation with one slide "Potential topics for discussion"
-  Right after each presentation, we will ask the author whether there is something he/she would like to add.
-  When you can't answer the question you may refer to the original author.

#Objectives of the workshop: Building on Previous Years

The very first WOOR workshop was organized in 1997 in conjunction with the ESEC/FSE'97 Conference in Zurich, Switzerland. During these 10 years, participants to the workshop have been actively contributing to the state-of-the-art on reengineering of object-oriented systems. During this special anniversary edition, we want to continue in that tradition. Therefore, we explicitly sollicit position papers that reflect on the past 10 years and/or build a vision of what the future 10 years might bring. Therefore, we welcome contributions from researchers, tool producers, and methodology providers in addition to position papers on the past and next 10 years of OO reengineering:

Areas of interests include, but are not limited to:

-  Overview papers, reflecting on the history of object-oriented reengineering
-  Vision papers, predicting what the next 10 years might bring
-  Experiences on re-engineering large object-oriented systems
-  Migration towards aspect-orientation
-  Design model extraction
-  Documentation and re-use of object-oriented systems
-  Analysis of object-oriented systems with respect to re-usability and flexibility
-  Abstract models of object-oriented systems that help to understand and re-engineer large programs
-  Refactoring Operations
-  Software Evolution
-  Metrics or heuristics to measure the need for, the progress of, and improvement to object-oriented design
-  Design patterns in reengineering practices
-  Software Evolution Analysis and Visualization
-  Tools supporting any of the above activities.

#Schedule of the Workshop

As is tradition in WOOR, we actively seek a format which emphasizes fruitful interactions and discussions. This typically involves brief (5 minute) presentations of position papers; break-up sessions in discussion groups, and plenary meetings to discuss results. Sometimes we ask that participants present and summarize someone else's position paper, which has proven to be a very pleasant way to stimulate discussion.

#Intended Audience

The workshop is intended to software engineering professionals with experience in object-oriented reengineering; either people who are actively engaged in reengineering projects, or people who develop or research methodologies and tools. Each participant is requested to submit a position paper in advance and each participant is supposed to read all the submitted material, so that the workshop itself can be devoted to discussion instead of presentations. Submissions will be made electronically to facilitate the rapid exchange of information.

The upper limit for the number of participants is 25 and the participants will be selected on the basis of the submitted contribution.

#Submission Guidelines


-  BE ELECTRONIC. Submit your position paper in PDF, so that we can collect all of the submissions on the web-site. A separate abstract including the e-mail addresses of the authors and a URL to their home pages MUST be submitted in HTML. Submit everything by e-mail to both of the two following e-mail addresses guehene@iro.umontreal.ca and roel.wuyts@imec.be.


-  BE SHORT. Propose only one idea. We all know that you are a quality researcher with plenty of good ideas. Only, we have limited resources and we must focus. Please keep all position papers under five pages. Perhaps a workshop reader will be organized again this year.


-  BE INNOVATIVE. It is okay to propose a recent idea that still has some unfinished sides to it. It is supposed to be a WORKshop, not a mini-conference.


-  BE A REBEL. Neglect these guidelines if you feel that your idea needs a special treatment in some way.

#Sponsoring

This event is partly sponsored by the Interuniversity Attraction Poles Programme - Belgian State &mdash; Belgian Science Policy, via the MoVES research project (\*Modelling, Verification and Evolution of Software>http://prog.vub.ac.be/moves/\*) with grant number P6/39.
