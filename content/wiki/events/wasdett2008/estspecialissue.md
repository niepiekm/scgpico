## <big>Special Issue: Experimental Software and Toolkits (EST)</big>

<big>[Elsevier Science of Computer Programming](http://www.elsevier.com/wps/find/journaldescription.cws_home/505623/description#description)</big>

The guest editors of the special issue will be Mark van den Brand and Kim Mens, two of the organisers of this workshop. Together with all organisers and the workshop's program committee, they will act as reviewers for this journal. The idea of this special issue is to allow academic software developers to publish the software system they developed together with a short paper. Only software systems of sufficiently high quality will be accepted for publication in the journal. In other words, in addition to the short paper the actual software system itself will be evaluated based upon the following criteria: ease of installation, quality of (user) documentation, ease of usage, and applicability to the indented domain.
