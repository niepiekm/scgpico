Title: CUSO Seminar on Improving Presentation Skills
---

#What?
People attending this workshop should be able to spot key elements that will
allow them to improve their skill to do presentations.

Presentations are an important part of the research activity. Presentations are not only about content but also the form on which this content is presented. How the presenter is using the space, how is the intensity of his/her voice, how is he/she using visual support, etc. Having a strategy to cope with presentation seems a must. This workshop aims to provide attendants with tools for improving their presentations skills.

##Methodology
Interactive, theory explanation, individual and small team work, use of digital media to video tape.

Participants are required to bring their smart phone/tablet and headphones for self-learning tapes. Please be sure it has enough space and battery to record at least 20 mins. (exceptionally additional media/camera will be available if needed).
