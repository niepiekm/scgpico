#Topics
The workshop is concerned with all aspects of the search experience of software developers. Search-driven development involves a broad range of activities and topics: from finding reusable software assets to finding experts within an organization; from using the mighty "grep" to using internet-scale search engines dedicated to software artifacts; from finding matching code fragments based on a simple text query to based on a given unit-test. We are looking forward to exciting and stimulating discussions about all these ideas&mdash;and much more&mdash;at the workshop!

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:


-  Applications and tools for searching software artifacts.
-  Approaches to search for developer expertise.
-  Crawling, analysis and parsing of internet-scale code repositories.
-  Empirical studies of search and navigation in IDEs.
-  Experience reports on setting up and running large software search engines.
-  Information retrieval techniques to search software.
-  Intergration of search engines with IDEs.
-  Just in time comprehension tools for developers.
-  Leveraging Web 2.0 and social computing techniques for developers' information needs.
-  Machine learning approaches to search software.
-  Methods of integrating indexed data from various sources and histories.
-  Natural language processing to support software development.
-  Novel argumentation models for searching in software message boards and email archives.
-  Programming by example.
-  Query languages for software search.
-  Ranking strategies and heuristics for code search.
-  Search techniques to assist developers in finding components and code fragments for reuse.
-  Recommendation systems for software development.
-  Slicing and generative techniques for code extraction and synthesis.
-  Standards and benchmarks for the evaluation of search tools.
-  The use of visualizations to support software search.
-  Experts finding for software development.
-  Understanding information needs of software developers.
