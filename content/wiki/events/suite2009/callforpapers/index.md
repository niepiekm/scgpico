# Motivation and Goals

As software development is a process of both information creation and information gathering, software developers are constantly searching for the right information and person to solve their problems at hand. This workshop will focus specifically on exploring the notion of search as a fundamental activity during software development. The goal of the workshop is to bring researchers and practitioners with special interest on search technology for software developers together. Participants will have broad range of expertise in topics ranging from building software tools and infrastructure, information retrieval, user studies and HCI, benchmarking and evaluation.

We intend the workshop to facilitate interested researchers that share their ideas and experience in understanding: search need and search behavior of developers, how to building tools that address these various needs, and scientific ways to evaluate these tools.

## Topics

The workshop is concerned with all aspects of the search experience of software developers. Search-driven development involves a broad range of activities and topics: from finding reusable software assets to finding experts within an organization; from using the mighty "grep" to using internet-scale search engines dedicated to software artifacts; from finding matching code fragments based on a simple text query to based on a given unit-test. We are looking forward to exciting and stimulating discussions about all these ideas&mdash;and much more&mdash;at the workshop!

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:


-  Applications and tools for searching software artifacts.
-  Approaches to search for developer expertise.
-  Crawling, analysis and parsing of internet-scale code repositories.
-  Empirical studies of search and navigation in IDEs.
-  Experience reports on setting up and running large software search engines.
-  Information retrieval techniques to search software.
-  Intergration of search engines with IDEs.
-  Just in time comprehension tools for developers.
-  Leveraging Web 2.0 and social computing techniques for developers' information needs.
-  Machine learning approaches to search software.
-  Methods of integrating indexed data from various sources and histories.
-  Natural language processing to support software development.
-  Novel argumentation models for searching in software message boards and email archives.
-  Programming by example.
-  Query languages for software search.
-  Ranking strategies and heuristics for code search.
-  Search techniques to assist developers in finding components and code fragments for reuse.
-  Recommendation systems for software development.
-  Slicing and generative techniques for code extraction and synthesis.
-  Standards and benchmarks for the evaluation of search tools.
-  The use of visualizations to support software search.
-  Experts finding for software development.
-  Understanding information needs of software developers.

# Intended Audience

The workshop is intended for:

-  Researchers with interest in enhancing search technology for developers.
-  Tool builders that want to improve the search experience of developers.
-  HCI Researchers with interest in better understanding of the search needs of developers
-  Search-engine providers from the industry targetting the needs of developers and software industry

Each participant is requested to submit a position paper in advance and each participant is requested to read all the submitted material, so that the workshop itself can be devoted to discussion instead of presentations. Submissions will be made electronically to facilitate the rapid exchange of information.

The upper limit for the number of participants is 25 and the participants will be selected on the basis of the submitted contribution.

We actively seek a format which emphasizes fruitful interactions and discussions. This involves brief (5 minute) presentations of position papers; break-up sessions in discussion groups, and plenary meetings to discuss results. We ask that participants present and summarize someone else's position paper, which has proven to be a very pleasant way to stimulate discussion.

# Submission Guidelines

<b>Be electronic.</b> Submit your position paper in PDF, using the workshop's <u>[EasyChair website](http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?c=.113876;conf=suite09)</u>, so that we can collect and publish all of the submissions on the web-site. Accepted submissions will be included in the IEEE digital library.

Submissions should be made in the IEEE Proceedings format. Please follow the style guidelines as prescribed by [ICSE](http://www.cs.uoregon.edu/events/icse2009/calls/format/?n=DR), also detailed in the [IEEE web page](http://www.computer.org/portal/site/cscps/menuitem.02df7cde46985ea21618fc2e6bcd45f3/index.jsp?&pName=cscps_level1&path=cscps/cps&file=cps_forms.xml&xsl=generic.xsl&).

<b>Be short.</b> Please keep all position papers under four pages.

<b>Be innovative.</b> It is okay to propose a recent idea that still has some unfinished sides to it. It is supposed to be a <u>work</u>shop, not a mini-conference.

<b>Be a rebel.</b> Neglect these guidelines if you feel that your idea needs a special treatment in some way.
