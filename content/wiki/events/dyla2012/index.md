Title: Dyla 2012

#Dyla 2012
The **DYLA Workshop** series focuses on the revival of dynamic languages. These days, dynamic languages (like Lisp, Ruby, Python, JavaScript, Lua, etc...) are getting ever more popular. This is a call to arms for academia! We need to explore the future of dynamic languages through its human aspects and technical issues. We also ought to look back and pick up solutions from existing dynamic languages (such as Scheme, Smalltalk, or Self) to be rediscovered and spread around.

#Demos Call

Are you involved in the development of a cool application written in a dynamically typed language that you use for your research? Do you want to share it and have the opportunity to pair-program with new people?
Demonstrating it at Dyla is a wonderful opportunity to get feedback on it and it gives a chance to people to be involved in your development by pair programming.

Dyla has a session in the morning about flash demos. People will have between 5 and 10 minutes to show their tools. We just need from you a short abstract (plain text, no .pdf, sent to the organizers) of your presentation. The abstract may contain link to website and screenshots. Deadline for sending abstract is June 5. The public will then have a chance to know you. Lunch and coffee breaks should be used to find pair-programming mates.

We will have two pair programming sessions in the afternoon. You can then pair program on two different projects. You should think in advance about a programming topic. Good programming topics are fixing a bug, adding a new and small feature, or applying your tool to solve a problem of your mate.

At the end of the day, you will have shown your project to the World, have met new people with a different background, and a new software contribution in your tool authored by someone outside your development team.

#Goal and Topics

The goal of this workshop is to act as a forum where we can discuss new advances in the design, implementation and application of dynamically typed languages that, sometimes radically, diverge from the  statically typed class-based mainstream with limited reflective capabilities. Another objective of the workshop is to discuss new as well as older ``forgotten\'' languages and features in this context. 


The workshop will have a demo-oriented style. The idea is to allow participants to demonstrate new and interesting features and discuss what they feel is relevant for the dynamic language community. All participants need to submit a two-page description ([LNCS format](http://www.springer.com/)) of their presentation or/and tool demonstration.
Each accepted paper will be presented for 20&mdash;30 minutes. Moreover, all workshop attendees will have the opportunity, if they wish, to give 10-minute “lightning demos” of whatever they bring with them. A dedicated session will be allocated for this, provided there is ample time available.
A session on pair programming is also planned. People will then get a chance to share their technology by closely interacting with other participants.

The expected audience of this workshop is practitioners and researchers sharing the same interest in dynamically typed languages. Lua, Python, Ruby, Scheme and Smalltalk are gaining a significant popularity both in industry and academia. However, each community has the tendency to only look at what it produced. Broadening the scope of each community is the goal of the workshop. To achieve this goal we will form a PC with leading persons from all languages mentioned above, fostering participation from all targeted communities. 


Topics of interest include, but are certainly not limited to: 


- what features make a language a dynamic one? 
- agents, actors, active object, distribution, concurrency and mobility 
- delegation, prototypes, mixins, traits 
- first-class closures, continuations, environments 
- reflection and meta-programming 
- (dynamic) aspects for dynamic languages 
- higher-order objects & messages 
- other exotic dynamic features 
- multi-paradigm & static/dynamic-marriages 
- (concurrent/distributed/mobile/aspect) virtual machines 
- optimization of dynamic languages 
- automated reasoning about programs written in dynamic languages 
- improved or novel IDE support for dynamic languages 
- empirical studies about the application of dynamic languages 
- best practices and patterns specific to dynamic languages 
- use of dynamic features by library & framework developers 
- reverse engineering and analysis of dynamic applications 
- program correctness through unit testing (as opposed to types) 
- applications of dynamic languages: embedded systems, robotic systems, web-site, ... 
- Smalltalk, Python, Ruby, Javascript, Scheme, Lisp, Self, ABCL, Prolog, etc.
- live coding 
- any topic relevant in applying and/or supporting dynamic languages. 

And any topic relevant in applying and/or supporting dynamic languages: Smalltalk, Python, Ruby, Javascript, Scheme, Lisp, Self, ABCL, Prolog, Ioke, Clojure and many more...

#Demos

-  **Information Flow Monitor for JavaScript.** Luciano Bello - The ability to detect real-world information leaks in web applications is one on the major promises in the language-base security field. This demo features a prototype of a JavaScript security monitor deployed in a browser. We illustrate how information leaks are prevented by the monitor by way of examples of insecure and secure web pages. The demo is based on work-in-progress, joint with Arnar Birgisson, Daniel Hedin, and Andrei Sabelfeld.
