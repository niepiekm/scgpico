Title: Dyla2011
---

The **DYLA Workshop** series focuses on the revival of dynamic languages. These days, dynamic languages (like Lisp, Ruby, Python, JavaScript, Lua, etc...) are getting ever more popular. This is a call to arms for academia! We need to explore the future of dynamic languages through its human aspects and technical issues. We also ought to look back and pick up solutions from existing dynamic languages (such as Scheme, Smalltalk, or Self) to be rediscovered and spread around.

#Goal and Topics

The goal of this workshop is to act as a forum where we can discuss new advances in the design, implementation and application of dynamically typed languages that, sometimes radically, diverge from the  statically typed class-based mainstream with limited reflective capabilities. Another objective of the workshop is to discuss new as well as older ``forgotten\'' languages and features in this context. 

Topics of interest include, but are certainly not limited to: 

**Human aspects** of dynamic languages, for example...


- empirical studies about the application of dynamic languages 
- best practices and patterns specific to dynamic languages 
- program correctness through unit testing (as opposed to types) 
- improved or novel IDE support for dynamic languages 
- use of dynamic features by library & framework developers 
- scripting of static application with dynamic languages 
- reverse engineering and analysis of dynamic applications 

**Technical aspects** of dynamic languages, for example...


- what features make a language a dynamic one? 
- agents, actors, active object, distribution, concurrency and mobility 
- delegation, prototypes, mixins, traits 
- first-class closures, continuations, environments 
- reï¬ection and meta-programming 
- (dynamic) aspects for dynamic languages 
- higher-order objects & messages 
- ...other exotic dynamic features 
- multi-paradigm & static/dynamic-marriages 
- (concurrent/distributed/mobile/aspect) virtual machines 
- optimisation of dynamic languages 
- automated reasoning about programs written in dynamic languages 
-  type systems for dynamic languages, pluggable types, partial typing, type reconstruction...

And any topic relevant in applying and/or supporting dynamic languages: Smalltalk, Python, Ruby, Javascript, Scheme, Lisp, Self, ABCL, Prolog, Ioke, Clojure and many more...


#Program


- 09:00 - 10:30 &mdash; Paper session 1
- 11:00 - 13:00 &mdash; Paper session 2 / Flash demo
- 14:30 - 15:30 &mdash; Flash demo
- 16:00 - 17:30 &mdash; Pair programming session

*Papers:*

- **Executable rules of encoding**, by John Moore. [PDF](http://scg.unibe.ch/download/dyla/2011/dyla11_submission_1.pdf)
- **A Static Type Inference for Python, by Eva Maia**, Nelma Moreira and Rogério Reis. [PDF](http://scg.unibe.ch/download/dyla/2011/dyla11_submission_3.pdf)
- **DoodleDebug, Beyond textual visualizations of objects**, by Niko Schwarz. [PDF](http://scg.unibe.ch/download/dyla/2011/dyla11_submission_4.pdf)
- **Test Coverage With Hapao** by Vanessa Pena and Alexandre Bergel. [PDF](http://scg.unibe.ch/download/dyla/2011/dyla11_submission_5.pdf)

Each paper will be presented for approx 30 minutes.

The flash demo sessions gives a chance to people who have not submitted a paper to demonstrate.

During the day, we will collect idea and proposal for pair programming session. The idea of this session is to seat down with someone you do not know, and code together. This is a great opportunity to shows the internal of what you are currently developing. Good topics for pair programming includes fixing a minor bug, adding a small feature, doing a tutorial.

#Submissions

The workshop will have a demo-oriented style. The idea is to allow participants to demonstrate new and interesting features and discuss what they feel is relevant for the dynamic language community. Participants need to **submit a 2â4 page position paper **of their work in [ACM sig-alternate.cls](http://www.acm.org/sigs/publications/proceedings-templates) format. At the workshop, participants will be asked to give 10-minute âlightning demosâ of their contributions.

#Targeted audience

The expected audience of this workshop is to gather practitioners and researchers 
sharing the same interest in dynamically typed languages. Ruby, Python, Smalltalk, 
Scheme and Lua are gaining a signiï¬cant popularity both in industry and academia. 
However, each community has the tendency to only look at what it produced. 
Broadening the scope of each community is the goal of the workshop. To achieve 
this goal we will form a PC with leading persons from all languages mentioned 
above, this should foster participation from all targeted communities.
