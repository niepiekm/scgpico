# Goals and Motivation

As software development is a process of both information creation and
information gathering, software developers are constantly searching
for the right information and the right person to solve their problems
at hand.  This workshop will focus specifically on exploring the
notion of search as a fundamental activity during software
development.  The general theme of our workshop is to adress topics
related to \''understanding and fulfilling various information
needs of software developers\''.  The goal of the workshop is to bring
researchers and practitioners with special interest on these topics
together.  Participants will have broad range of expertise in topics
ranging from building software tools and infrastructure, information
retrieval, user studies and HCI, benchmarking and evaluation.

# Intended Audience

The workshop is intended for:


-  Researchers with interest in enhancing search technology for developers.
-  Tool builders that want to improve the search experience of developers.
-  HCI Researchers with interest in better understanding of the search needs of - Search-engine providers from the industry targeting the needs of developers and software industry

Each participant is requested to submit a position paper in advance
and each participant is requested to read all the submitted material,
so that the workshop itself can be devoted to discussion instead of
presentations. Submissions will be made electronically to facilitate
the rapid exchange of information.

The upper limit for the number of participants is 30 and the
participants will be selected on the basis of the submitted
contribution. We actively seek a format which emphasizes fruitful
interactions and discussions. This involves brief (5 minute)
presentations of position papers; break-up sessions in discussion
groups, and plenary meetings to discuss results. 

# Submission Guidelines

Submissions can span one or more of the following general categories:

-  Human Factors
-  Industry/Experience Report
-  Software Analysis
-  Software Information Retrieval
-  Tool Building

**Be electronic.** Submit your position paper (no more than 4 pages) in PDF, using the workshop's Cyberchair website, so that we can collect and publish all  of the submissions on the website. Accepted submissions will be included in the ACM digital library. Submissions should be made in the ACM Proceedings format. Please follow the style guidelines as prescribed by ICSE, also detailed in the ACM web page.

**Be short.** Please keep all position papers under 4 pages.

**Be innovative.** It is okay to propose a recent idea that still has some unfinished sides to it. It is supposed to be a workshop, not a mini-conference.

**Be a rebel.** Neglect these guidelines if you feel that your idea needs a special treatment in some way.
