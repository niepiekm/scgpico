Title: Identifer analysis

#Identifer analysis
We present a five-steps approach for analysing identifiers in a software, based on natural Language processing techniques: segmentation, part-of-speech tagging, dependency analysis, construction of lexical views. Lexical views on the Salom√©-tmf software are constructed, and precision of the main steps is assessed on 360 identifiers.
