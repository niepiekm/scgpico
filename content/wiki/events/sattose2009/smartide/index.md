Title: Smart tools/IDE
---

Some topics:

-  visual environment (navigation/coding)
-  code cloning
-  collaborative tools
-  history-based completion (Romain Robbes)


-  [http://hillside.net/plop/2006/Papers/ACM_Version/A_Pattern_Language_for_Extensible_Program_Representation.pdf](http://hillside.net/plop/2006/Papers/ACM_Version/A_Pattern_Language_for_Extensible_Program_Representation.pdf)



-  re-thinking the IDE, not center on the code editor; begin with other views?
-  orthogonal tools for selection vs analysis (allows one to select whatever data he wants to put in an analysis tool)
(nowadays tools are often monolithic)


selection mechanisms:

-  scope mechanism of Refactoring Browser - scoped impact
-  smart groups of OB - used with search
-  groups in Moose - query


-  use of annotation to tag data (false positive...)
-  degree-of-interest model


navigation mechanisms:

-  visual metaphors to navigate in code
-  daisy browser, daisy interaction (mouse movement based)


King browser:

-  empty browser which dynamically populates with classes and methods browsed (landmarks): populate-and-forget (pin down landmark)
-  dedicated browser for navigation/browsing only on the side
