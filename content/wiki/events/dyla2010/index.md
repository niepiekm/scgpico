Title: Welcome to DYLA 2010

#Welcome to DYLA 2010
The **DYLA Workshop** series focuses on the revival of dynamic languages. These days, dynamic languages (like Lisp, Ruby, Python, JavaScript, Lua, etc...) are getting ever more popular. This is a call to arms for academia! We need to explore the future of dynamic languages through its human aspects and technical issues. We also ought to look back and pick up solutions from existing dynamic languages (such as Scheme, Smalltalk, or Self) to be rediscovered and spread around.

Dyla is now over. A twitter report may be found on [http://twitter.com/dyla2010](http://twitter.com/dyla2010).
Slides used for the organization are [available](http://bergel.eu/download/Dyla2010/2010-Dyla.pdf).

Some pictures of the event are available on [facebook](http://www.facebook.com/album.php?id=542496659&aid=231499). 

See you next year!

# Goal and Topics

The goal of this workshop is to act as a forum where we can discuss new advances in the design, implementation and application of dynamically typed languages that, sometimes radically, diverge from the statically typed class-based 
mainstream with limited reflective capabilities. Another objective of the workshop is to discuss new as well as older "forgotten" languages and features in this context. 

Topics of interest include, but are certainly not limited to: 

**Human aspects** of dynamic languages, for example...


- empirical studies about the application of dynamic languages 
- best practices and patterns specific to dynamic languages 
- program correctness through unit testing (as opposed to types) 
- improved or novel IDE support for dynamic languages 
- use of dynamic features by library & framework developers 
- scripting of static application with dynamic languages 
- reverse engineering and analysis of dynamic applications 

**Technical aspects** of dynamic languages, for example...


- what features make a language a dynamic one? 
- agents, actors, active object, distribution, concurrency and mobility 
- delegation, prototypes, mixins, traits 
- first-class closures, continuations, environments 
- refiection and meta-programming 
- (dynamic) aspects for dynamic languages 
- higher-order objects & messages 
- ...other exotic dynamic features 
- multi-paradigm & static/dynamic-marriages 
- (concurrent/distributed/mobile/aspect) virtual machines 
- optimisation of dynamic languages 
- automated reasoning about programs written in dynamic languages 
-  type systems for dynamic languages, pluggable types, partial typing, type reconstruction...

And any topic relevant in applying and/or supporting dynamic languages: Smalltalk, Python, Ruby, Javascript, Scheme, Lisp, Self, ABCL, Prolog, Ioke, Clojure and many more...


# Program
The program will be split over 3 different sessions and 6 presentations:

- *Virtual machine & interpreter* (9:30 - 11:00)
	- David Schneider, Carl Friedrich Bolz and Michael Leuschel. **Jitting Prolog for Fun and Profit**. [PDF](http://bergel.eu/download/Dyla2010/schneider-prolog-jit-final.pdf)
	- Baltasar GarcÃ­a Perez-Schofield and Francisco OrtÃ­n Soler. **A dynamic virtual machine for the support of interoperable programming languages**. [PDF](http://bergel.eu/download/Dyla2010/dyla10_submission_5.pdf)

- *Tools* (11:30 - 13:00)
	- Alexandre Bergel. **Agile Code Profiling Visualization**. [PDF](http://bergel.eu/download/Dyla2010/Berg10d-ProfilingVisualization.pdf)
	- Rocky Bernstein. **Debuggers in Dynamic Languages**. [PDF](http://bergel.eu/download/Dyla2010/dyla10_submission_1.pdf)

- *Languages* (14:30 - 16:00)
	- Michaël Hoste and Tom Mens. **Visual Scripting Language**. [PDF](http://bergel.eu/download/Dyla2010/dyla10_submission_6.pdf)
	- Lukas Renggli, Stéphane Ducasse, Tudor Gîrba and Oscar Nierstrasz. **Practical Dynamic Grammars for Dynamic Languages**. [PDF](http://bergel.eu/download/Dyla2010/dyla10_submission_4.pdf)

- *Discussion/Coding session* (16:30 - 18:00)

We expect the presentation length to range from 10 minutes and 30 minutes. In addition to this, we will have an extra session about discussion or coding. Pair programming is an excellent mechanism to get known each other and increase the interactivity among participants.

# Recommandation for presenters

As you can see, 45 mn is allocated per presentation. This is a lot of time. It is important that you keep your presentation focused. You do not have to fill these 45 mn. 30 mn or even less is perfectly okay. We will have more time for discussion and pair programming.

The central point of your presentation is the demonstration of your tool. You may need a few slides to illustrate the general concept although. This is okay. 

Please, be sure that you keep the audience entertained, interested and motivated to follow the complete presentation. You should expect the audience to ask questions and tickle you on where it hurts :-)

# Submissions

The workshop will have a demo-oriented style. The idea is to allow participants to demonstrate new and interesting features and discuss what they feel is relevant for the dynamic language community. Participants need to **submit a 2&mdash;4 page position paper **of their work in [ACM sig-alternate.cls](http://www.acm.org/sigs/publications/proceedings-templates) format. At the workshop, participants will be asked to give 10-minute “lightning demos” of their contributions. 

Submission page is https://www.easychair.org/login.cgi?conf=dyla10

# Targeted audience

The expected audience of this workshop is to gather practitioners and researchers 
sharing the same interest in dynamically typed languages. Ruby, Python, Smalltalk, 
Scheme and Lua are gaining a significant popularity both in industry and academia. 
However, each community has the tendency to only look at what it produced. 
Broadening the scope of each community is the goal of the workshop. To achieve 
this goal we will form a PC with leading persons from all languages mentioned 
above, this should foster participation from all targeted communities.
