Position Paper Rules


-  Be standard. There exists a lot of work on re-engineering, which may give rise to some terminology conflicts. We encourage people to use the re-engineering taxonomy defined in Reverse Engineering and Design Recovery : A Taxonomy by E.J. Chikofsky and J.H. Cross II &mdash; IEEE Software, January 1990. Check [http://www.tcse.org/revengr/taxonomy.htm](http://www.tcse.org/revengr/taxonomy.htm) for an online summary.


-  Be electronic. Submit your position paper in HTML, postcript or PDF (preferably), so that we can collect all of the submissions on a web-site. A separate abstract including the e-mail addresses of the authors and URL's of their home pages MUST be submitted in HTML. You can find a templatehere. Submit everything by e-mail to roel.wuyts <b>and</b> to Bart.Dubois.


-  Be short. Propose only one idea. We all know that you are a quality researcher with plenty of good ideas. Only, we have limited resources and we must focus. Please keep all position papers under five pages. A workshop reader will be perhaps organized this year again.


-  Be innovative. Propose some recent idea that still has some unfinished sides to it. It is supposed to be a WORKshop, not a mini-conference.


-  Be a rebel. Neglect these guidelines if you feel that your idea needs a special treatment in some way.
