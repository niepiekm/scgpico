    (Workshop reader, next workshop, ...)

<h2>EQUIPMENT</h2>

There will be one data-projector and one flip-chart available. Those that need/want to present something should bring their own laptops. Its probably also a good idea to bring some extra wires for electricity.

<h2>REGISTRATION</h2>

The ECOOP organisation reminded us that you should be registered properly to attend the workshop. B.t.w.: experience with previous ECOOP learned that it is probably best to register the evening before &mdash; in the morning it can be quite busy and you don't want to miss the introduction session do you ?

<h2>WORKSHOP READER</h2>

As is the tradition, all workshop will produce a report that will be bundled into a workshop reader. Some post-workshop volunteers will be necessary to write the reports.

<h2>POSTER</h2>

We have the option of producing a poster summarizing what we did and learned. We have space for an A1 poster connected to their workshop (See http://2005.ecoop.org/callForPosters.html for details). There is the option of printing A4 black and white paper to produce the poster.
