#Objective
The ability to reengineer object-oriented legacy systems has become a vital matter in today's software industry. Early adopters of the object-oriented programming paradigm are now facing the problems of transforming their object-oriented "legacy" systems into full-fledged frameworks.

This Workshop on Object-Oriented Reengineering wants to gather people working on solutions for object-oriented legacy systems, and will be set up as a forum for exchanging experiences, discussing solutions, and exploring new ideas. We explicitly sollicit experience reports from the software industry as well as contributions from tool produces and methodology providers.

Areas of interests include, but are not limited to:

- experiences on re-engineering large OO systems
- design model extraction
- documentation and re-use of OO systems
- analysis of OO systems with respect to re-usability and flexibility
- abstract models of OO systems that help to understand and re-engineer large programs
- methodological support for the transformation of OO systems into frameworks
- refactoring operations
- repositories for code analysis
- metrics or heuristics to measure the need for, the progress of, and improvement to OO design
- design patterns in reengineering practices
- tools supporting all of the above activities

#Intended Audience
The workshop is intended for software engineering professionals with experience in OO reengineering; either people who are actively engaged in reengineering projects, or people who develop methodologies and tools.

#Important Dates

- April 5, 2004: Submission of position papers
- April 26: Notification of acceptance.

The organizers of the workshop are from the University of Berne, Switzerland, the University of Antwerp, Belgium, the University of Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium, and the Université Libre de Bruxelles, Belgium.
Prof. Stéphane Ducasse, from the University of Berne, is a member of the Software Composition Group headed by Prof. Oscar Nierstrasz.
Prof. Serge Demeyer is leading a research group investigating the theme of "Software Reengineering" (LORE - Lab On REengineering).
They are the authors of the book "Object-Oriented Reengineering Patterns" published by Morgan Kaufman.

Prof. Kim Mens is one of the originators of the "reuse contract" technique for automatically detecting conflicts in evolving software and is currently interested in the problem of "co-evolution" between source code and earlier life-cycle software artifacts.

Prof. Roel Wuyts started the Soul language, a logic programming language living in symbiosis with Smalltalk. Soul is primarily used to query source code for structural patterns.
