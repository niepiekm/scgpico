#Outcome of the Workshop

This year again, the workshop has been successful in stirring new ideas and in creating new collaborations. In particular, the two "halves" of the workshop worked tirelessly to provide directions to some issues raised during the presentations (one half) and (other half) to sketch a solution to the research question "Are implicit design patterns useful in program comprehension" collaboratively. A workshop report and more detailled results will be posted here soon. In the meantime, here are some pictures of the participants: [WOOR2006 Photo 1](%assets_url%/files/56/oqftxrpzljsjydnmrpoip3qrxmupcw/WOOR2006%20Photo%201) and [WOOR2006 Photo 2](%assets_url%/files/71/zr7ph0aikg24ch9bx1yp8ravi8z4cw/WOOR2006%20Photo%202).

#Important Dates

Workshop Contribution Submission: <b>15th of April 2006</b>. (The deadline is over but feel free to contact us to check if it is still possible to contribute1)
Notification of acceptance: <b>1st of May 2006</b>. (Notifications has been sent to the authods on the 3rd of May, if you did not receive any, please contact the organisers.)
Workshop date: <b>4th of July 2006</b>.

#Contributions: Building on Previous Years

In previous years, participants to the workshop have been actively contributing to the state-of-the-art on reengineering of object-oriented systems. In particular, they developed a taxonomy to classify design recovery tools, at the heart of any reengineering effort. Recognising the importance of this endeavour and the need for the community's feedback and support, the workshop expects two forms of contributions:


-  The first form of contributions targets design recovery tool builders and users. It consists in filling out the questionnaire (soon) available at this [Form](%base_url%/wiki/events/woor2006/form) and submitting it along with a short text detailing the rationale for the choice of the tools. This information, in addition to the discussions during the workshop, will help building a map of the design recovery tools out there. <b>If you are interested in this form of contribution or have any question, please contact either Yann-Gaël Guéhéneuc (<a href="mailto:guehene@iro.umontreal.ca">guehene@iro.umontreal.ca</a>
) or Roel Wuyts (<a href="mailto:roel.wuyts@ulb.ac.be">roel.wuyts@ulb.ac.be</a>
).</b> (The questionnaire will be soon available at http://smallwiki.unibe.ch/woor/questionnaire/.)
-  The second form of contributions targets researchers and industrials active in reengineering. We explicitly solicit experience reports from the software industry as well as contributions from researchers, tool producers, and methodology providers. Areas of interests include, but are not limited to:

-  Experiences on re-engineering large object-oriented systems
-  Design model extraction
-  Documentation and re-use of object-oriented systems
-  Analysis of object-oriented systems with respect to re-usability and flexibility
-  Abstract models of object-oriented systems that help to understand and re-engineer large programs
-  Methodological support for the transformation of object-oriented systems into frameworks
-  Refactoring Operations
-  Software Evolution
-  Metrics or heuristics to measure the need for, the progress of, and improvement to object-oriented design
-  Design patterns in reengineering practices
-  Reengineering object-oriented software to an aspect-oriented solution
-  Tools supporting any of the above activities.

#Workshop on Object-Oriented Reengineering

The ability to reengineer object-oriented legacy systems has become a vital matter in today's software industry. Early adopters of the object-oriented programming paradigm are now facing the problem of transforming their object-oriented "legacy" systems into full-fledged frameworks. Some are even starting to face the problem of reengineering their systems from object-oriented to aspect-oriented. We claim that software evolution and reengineering are among the core issues of software engineering, including object-oriented systems. Unfortunately, their importance is not yet fully acknowledged by current research and industrial efforts.

This workshop on Object-Oriented Reengineering is a unique opportunity for people working on object-oriented legacy systems to exchange ideas.

#Intended Audience

The workshop is intended to software engineering professionals with experience in object-oriented reengineering; either people who are actively engaged in reengineering projects, or people who develop or research methodologies and tools. Each participant is requested to submit a contribution (see above) in advance.

#Preparation

We pay special attention to the preparation of the workshop to make an efficient use of the day. We request each participant to submit a contribution in advance. Each participant is expected to read the material submitted by the other participants, so that all participants are acquainted with the ideas that exist within the group and that the workshop can be devoted to discussions instead of presentations. Submissions will be made electronically to ease the rapid exchange of information.

The upper limit for the number of participants is about 25 and the participants will be selected on the basis of the submitted contribution.

#Submission Guidelines

If you submit a contribution of the second form (i.e., an industrial or academic experience report), we suggest the following guidelines:


-  BE STANDARD. There exists a lot of work on re-engineering, which may give rise to some terminology conflicts. We encourage people to use the re-engineering taxonomy defined in Reverse Engineering and Design Recovery: A Taxonomy by E.J. Chikofsky and J.H. Cross II - IEEE Software, January 1990. Check [http://www.tcse.org/revengr/taxonomy.html](http://www.tcse.org/revengr/taxonomy.html) for an online summary.


-  BE ELECTRONIC. Submit your position paper in HTML, PostScript, or PDF (preferred), so that we can collect all of the submissions on the web-site. A separate abstract including the e-mail addresses of the authors and a URL to their home pages MUST be submitted in HTML. Submit everything by e-mail to both of the two following e-mail addresses <a href="mailto:guehene@iro.umontreal.ca">guehene@iro.umontreal.ca</a>
 and <a href="mailto:roel.wuyts@ulb.ac.be">roel.wuyts@ulb.ac.be</a>
.


-  BE SHORT. Propose only one idea. We all know that you are a quality researcher with plenty of good ideas. Only, we have limited resources and we must focus. Please keep all position papers under five pages. Perhaps a workshop reader will be organized again this year.


-  BE INNOVATIVE. It is okay to propose a recent idea that still has some unfinished sides to it. It is supposed to be a WORKshop, not a mini-conference.


-  BE A REBEL. Neglect these guidelines if you feel that your idea needs a special treatment in some way.
