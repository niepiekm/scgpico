#Workshop Call For Contributions

#Objectives of the Workshop

The ability to reengineer object-oriented legacy systems has become a vital matter in today's software industry. Early adopters of the object-oriented programming paradigm are now facing the problems of transforming their object-oriented "legacy" systems into full-fledged frameworks. We claim that software evolution and reengineering will become the key issue of software engineering, be it object-oriented or not. So far this shift of importance is not reflected by research and industrial efforts.

This Workshop on Object-Oriented Reengineering wants to gather people working on solutions for object-oriented legacy systems. We explicitly solicit experience reports from the software industry as well as contributions from tool producers and methodology providers. The workshop itself will be set up as a forum for exchanging experiences, discussing solutions, and exploring new ideas.
The workshop builds upon the following important related achievements:

- Related workshops on object-oriented software evolution and re-engineering held at OOPSLA'96, ECOOP'97, ESEC'97, ECOOP'98, the workshops on Software Reengineering WSR1999, WSR2000 and WSR2001, ECOOP'2003 and the Unanticipated Evolution Workshops held at ECOOP'2003 and ETAPS2003.
- The work done in the  FAMOOS project (Framework-based Approach for Mastering Object-Oriented Software Evolution), carried out within the ESPRIT IV framework.
- The Scientific Research Network on Foundations of Software Evolution funded by the Fund for Scientific Research &mdash;- Flanders, Belgium (\*http://prog.vub.ac.be/FFSE/network.html\*) and the related Scientific Network ``Research Links to Explore and Advance Software Evolution (RELEASE)\'' funded by the European Science Foundation Scientific Network (\*http://labmol.di.fc.ul.pt/projects/release/\*).

Areas of interests include, but are not limited to

- Experiences on re-engineering large object-oriented systems
- Design model extraction
- Documentation and re-use of object-oriented systems
- Analysis of object-oriented systems with respect to re-usability and flexibility
- Abstract models of object-oriented systems that help to understand and re-engineer large programs
- Methodological support for the transformation of object-oriented systems into frameworks
- Refactoring Operations
- Repositories for Code Analysis
- Metrics or heuristics to measure the need for, the progress of, and improvement to object-oriented design
- Design patterns in reengineering practices
- Tools supporting all of the above activities.

#ECOOP 2004

The Workshop is organised in conjunction with the ``18th European Conference in Object-Oriented Programming\'' ECOOP'2004, to be held in Oslo, Norway from June  14 to 18 (see [http://www.ifi.uio.no/ecoop2004/](http://www.ifi.uio.no/ecoop2004/)). 

#Intended Audience

The workshop is intended for software engineering professionals with experience in object-oriented reengineering; either people who are actively engaged in reengineering projects, or people who develop methodologies and tools. Each participant is requested to submit a position paper in advance.

Members of the Scientific Research Network on Foundations of Software Evolution or the related Scientific Network RELEASE may receive partial funding by their network (although this is an open workshop that explicitly solicits participants outside these networks as well). 

#Intended number of participants

Maximum 25 participants

#Preparation

In order to make efficient use of the day, we want to pay special attention to the preparation of the workshop. We request each participant to submit a position paper in advance, so that all participants can get acquainted with the ideas that exist within the group. Each participant is supposed to read all the submitted material, so that the workshop itself can be devoted to discussion instead of presentations. Submissions will be made electronically to facilitate the rapid exchange of information.

The upper limit for the number of participants is 25 and the participants will be selected on the basis of the submitted material. The maximum number of participants per position paper is limited to 2.

#Submission Guidelines

- Be Standard: There exists a lot of work on re-engineering, which may give rise to some terminology conflicts. We encourage people to use the re-engineering taxonomy defined in Reverse Engineering and Design Recovery : A Taxonomy by E.J. Chikofsky and J.H. Cross II &mdash; IEEE Software, January 1990. Check [http://www.tcse.org/revengr/taxonomy.htm](http://www.tcse.org/revengr/taxonomy.htm) for an online summary.
- Be electronic. Submit your position paper in HTML, postcript or PDF (preferably), so that we can collect all of the submissions on a web-site. A separate abstract including the e-mail addresses of the authors and URL's of their home pages MUST be submitted in HTML. Submit everything by e-mail to <b>both</b> of the following e-mail adresses: roel.wuyts and Bart.Dubois.
- Be short. Propose only one idea. We all know that you are a quality researcher with plenty of good ideas. Only, we have limited resources and we must focus. Please keep all position papers under five pages. A workshop reader will be perhaps organized this year again.
- Be innovative. Propose some recent idea that still has some unfinished sides to it. It is supposed to be a WORKshop, not a mini-conference.
- Be a rebel. Neglect these guidelines if you feel that your idea needs a special treatment in some way.

#Important Dates


- Workshop Contribution Submission: April 5, 2004.
- Notification of acceptance: April 26, 2004. 
- Workshop date: June 14 or 15

#About the Organizers

The organizers of the workshop are from the University of Berne, Switzerland, the University of Antwerp, Belgium, the University of Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium and the Université Libre de Bruxelles, Belgium. Prof. Stéphane Ducasse, from the University of Berne, is a member of the Software Composition Group headed by Prof. Oscar Nierstrasz. Prof. Serge Demeyer is leading a research group investigating the theme of "Software Reengineering" (LORE - Lab On REengineering). They are the authors of the book ``Object-Oriented Reengineering Patterns* published by Morgan Kaufman. Prof. Kim Mens is one of the originators of the ``reuse contract" technique for automatically detecting conflicts in evolving software and is currently interested in the problem of ``co-evolution* between source code and earlier life-cycle software artifacts. Prof. Roel Wuyts bootstrapped research in co-evolution of design and implementation with the declarative meta-programming language Soul.
