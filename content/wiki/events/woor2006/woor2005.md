#Objective

The ability to reengineer object-oriented legacy systems has become a vital matter in today's software industry. Early adopters of the object-oriented programming paradigm are now facing the problems of transforming their object-oriented "legacy" systems into full-fledged frameworks. Some are even starting to face the problem of how to reengineer their object-oriented solution to an aspect-oriented one. We claim that software evolution and reengineering are among the core issues of software engineering, be it object-oriented or not. Unfortunately, their importance is still not reflected by current research and industrial efforts.

This workshop on Object-Oriented Reengineering wants to gather people working on solutions for object-oriented legacy systems. We explicitly solicit experience reports from the software industry as well as contributions from researchers, tool producers and methodology providers. The workshop itself will be set up as a forum for exchanging experiences, discussing solutions, and exploring new ideas.

Areas of interests include, but are not limited to:

-  Experiences on re-engineering large object-oriented systems
-  Design model extraction
-  Documentation and re-use of object-oriented systems
-  Analysis of object-oriented systems with respect to re-usability and flexibility
-  Abstract models of object-oriented systems that help to understand and re-engineer large programs
-  Methodological support for the transformation of object-oriented systems into frameworks
-  Refactoring Operations
-  Software Evolution
-  Metrics or heuristics to measure the need for, the progress of, and improvement to object-oriented design
-  Design patterns in reengineering practices
-  Reengineering object-oriented software to an aspect-oriented solution
-  Tools supporting all of the above activities.

#Intended Audience

The workshop is intended for software engineering professionals with experience in object-oriented reengineering; either people who are actively engaged in reengineering projects, or people who develop or research methodologies and tools. Each participant is requested to submit a position paper in advance.

#Preparation

In order to make efficient use of the day, we want to pay special attention to the preparation of the workshop. We request each participant to submit a position paper in advance, so that all participants can get acquainted with the ideas that exist within the group. Each participant is supposed to read all the submitted material, so that the workshop itself can be devoted to discussion instead of presentations. Submissions will be made electronically to facilitate the rapid exchange of information.

The upper limit for the number of participants is 25 and the participants will be selected on the basis of the submitted material. The maximum number of participants per position paper is limited to 2.

#Submission Guidelines

##BE STANDARD
There exists a lot of work on re-engineering, which may give rise to some terminology conflicts. We encourage people to use the re-engineering taxonomy defined in Reverse Engineering and Design Recovery : A Taxonomy by E.J. Chikofsky and J.H. Cross II - IEEE Software, January 1990. Check [http://www.tcse.org/revengr/taxonomy.htm](http://www.tcse.org/revengr/taxonomy.htm) for an online summary.

##BE ELECTRONIC
Submit your position paper in HTML, postcript or PDF (preferably), so that we can collect all of the submissions on a web-site. A separate abstract including the e-mail addresses of the authors and URL's of their home pages MUST be submitted in HTML. Submit everything by e-mail to both of the two following e-mail addresses roel.wuyts@ulb.ac.be and kim.mens@info.ucl.ac.be

##BE SHORT
Propose only one idea. We all know that you are a quality researcher with plenty of good ideas. Only, we have limited resources and we must focus. Please keep all position papers under five pages. Perhaps a workshop reader will be organized again this year.
	
##BE INNOVATIVE
It is okay to propose a recent idea that still has some unfinished sides to it. It is supposed to be a WORKshop, not a mini-conference.

##BE A REBEL
Neglect these guidelines if you feel that your idea needs a special treatment in some way.

#About the Organizers

The organisers of the workshop are from the University of Berne, Switzerland, the University of Antwerp, Belgium, the University of Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium and the Universit'e Libre de Bruxelles, Belgium. Prof. Stéphane Ducasse, from the University of Berne, is a member of the Software Composition Group headed by Prof. Oscar Nierstrasz. Prof. Serge Demeyer is leading a research group investigating the theme of "Software Reengineering" (LORE - Lab On REengineering). They are the authors of the book 'Object-Oriented Reengineering Patterns' published by Morgan Kaufman. Prof. Kim Mens is one of the originators of the 'reuse contract' technique, he is the spokesperson of the Research Center on Structural Software Improvement and currently conducts research on 'co-evolution' between source code and earlier life-cycle software artifacts, as well as on aspect identification and refactoring. Prof. Roel Wuyts bootstrapped research in co-evolution of design and implementation with the declarative meta-programming language Soul.
