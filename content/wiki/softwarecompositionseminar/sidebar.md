#FAQ: Do I need to register for the seminar?

-  If you want credit for the seminar as a **MSc course**, you must register on *Academia* (also if you are a Bachelors student)
-  If you want credit for presenting your **MSc thesis** work (as opposed to seminar project), then please only register formally in your *final* semester
-  If you want credit for the seminar as a **Bachelors course**, you should register on *KSL*
-  If you need credit for a **Proseminar** (part of the Bachelors project), then you do *not* need to register. The grade will be filled in on the Bachelorarbeit in Informatik form.
