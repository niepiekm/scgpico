**Title:** Build your own DSL with Xtext  [Interactive Workshop]

**Presenter:** [Frank Buchli](http://www.linkedin.com/in/frankbuchli)

**Abstract:** With ![Xtext](http://www.xtext.org/) you can easily create your own
programming languages and domain-specific languages (DSLs). The framework
supports the development of language infrastructures including compilers
and interpreters as well as full blown Eclipse-based IDE integration.
In the workshop I will give a really short introduction the DSLs and how
they are used today in industrial (Java) projects.
The main goal of the workshop is that at the end you have built your own
DSL on your machine.

**Preparation:** Everybody should have downloaded and installed Xtext in Version 1.0.1.

*Download Link:* ![http://xtext.itemis.com/xtext/language=en/23947/downloads](http://xtext.itemis.com/xtext/language=en/23947/downloads)

During the workshop I will guide you through the [Xtext tutorial](http://www.eclipse.org/Xtext/documentation/latest/xtext.html#getting-started). It is not forbidden to have a look at it in advance.

If you wish to have another focus or have any other input / idea how /
what to change, just let me (Frank Buchli) know!
