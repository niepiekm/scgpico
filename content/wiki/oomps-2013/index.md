This is the page for the Oopsla Mock PC 2013 - our internal **simulation** of a PC that Oscar mentioned some time ago. 

We will have at our disposition 20-25 papers submitted to this year's OOPSLA which we will provide our own reviews, opinions and recommendations on. This will boil down to 7-10 papers per person. There will be one month at disposition for reviewing the papers. 

Important Dates:


-  April 3 - bidding for papers
-  April 4 - papers assigned
-  May 4 - reviews due
-  May 8 @ 13pm - Mock PC Meeting 

This is how the meeting looked like:
