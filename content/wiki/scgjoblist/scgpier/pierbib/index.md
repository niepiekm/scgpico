#Pierbib Requirements
#Done

-  auto-generate news items for new papers
-  all non-default query parameters saved in URL
-  auto-load scgbib whenever it changes
-  web interface for ad hoc queries
-  display format configuration (chronological, by author, by date, by publication type)
-  query by bibtex field
-  fixed urls for ad hoc queries
-  embedded bibliography lists for fixed queries (scg-phd etc)

#Nice to have:

-  complex queries (and/or/negation)
-  bibtex field queries
-  querying remote bibs
-  update scgbib from pier; generate scgbib instead of parsing it
