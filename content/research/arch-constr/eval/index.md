Title: Industrial Validation

Architectural rules are often defined but rarely tested. Current tools offer limited functionality and often require significant effort to be configured, automated and integrated within existing platforms. We propose a platform that aims at reducing the overall cost of setting up and maintaining an architectural conformance monitoring environment by decoupling the conceptual representation of a user-defined rule from its technical specification prescribed by the underlying analysis tools. The user is no longer expected to encode her constraints according to the semantics of the chosen tool, but can use a simple high-level DSL that is automatically compiled to an executable specification through custom adapters developed to support the interaction with existing off-the-shelf tools.
