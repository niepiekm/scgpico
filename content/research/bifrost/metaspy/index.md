Title: MetaSpy
---

Domain-specific languages and models are increasingly used within general-purpose host languages. While traditional profiling tools perform well on host language code itself, they often fail to provide meaningful results if the developers start to build and use abstractions on top of the host language. In this paper we motivate the need for dedicated profiling tools with three different case studies. Furthermore, we present an infrastructure that enables developers to quickly prototype new profilers for their domain-specific languages and models.
