#Indentation Parsing - OOPSLA 2015
Dear OOPSLA 2015 Reviewer, Dear Reader,

At this web page we provide:


-  The source code of our implementation of LS-PEGs
-  The LS-PEG definitions of Python, (Mini)Haskell, (Mini)F#, YAML and Markdown
-  The source code to run Python case study
-  The source code to run the performance measurements


You can download an archive with all the data you need [from here](/download/jk/oopsla2015/data.zip). 


The archive is organized as follows:

-  images (folder with Smalltalk images)
	-  final.image (Moose image containing all the data)

-  python-src (source codes for Python case study)
-  plots (scripts to render the measurements using gnuplot)
-  PharoVM\*.zip (VM to run the images from images folder)


The **image** files can be opened with the Pharo virtual machine that can be downloaded from [Pharo web page](http://pharo.org/download).

The latest version of indentation-sensitive parser can be found in [Moose](http://www.moosetechnology.org/).
