Dear SLE 2015 Reviewer, Dear Reader,

At this web page we provide:


-  The source code of our implementation of LS-PEGs
-  The LS-PEG definitions of MarkDown, Python, YAML, (Mini)Haskell and (Mini)F#
-  The source code to run Python case study
-  The source code to run the performance measurements

You can download an archive with all the data you need [from here](/download/jk/sle2015/data.zip). 


The archive is organized as follows:

-  images (folder with Smalltalk images)
	-  final.image (Moose image containing all the data)

-  python-src (source codes for Python case study)
-  plots (scripts to render the measurements using gnuplot)
-  PharoVM\*.zip (VM to run the images from images folder)

The **image** files can be opened with the Pharo virtual machine that can be downloaded from [Pharo web page](http://pharo.org/download).

The latest version of indentation-sensitive parser can be found in [Moose](http://www.moosetechnology.org/).
