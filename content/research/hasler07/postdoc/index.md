#Postdoc in Reverse engineering and quality assurance of J2EE applications


Software Composition Group, University of Bern, Switzerland is seeking candidates for a postdoctoral position in the area of reverse engineering and quality assurance of legacy J2EE applications.

 

The postdoc will work on providing a unified meta-model for J2EE applications and on devising new techniques (e.g., metrics, visualizations, clustering) to reverse engineer and analyze the quality of such applications. More details about the project can be found at: [http://www.iam.unibe.ch/~scg/Research/Hasler07/index.html](%base_url%/research/hasler07) 

 

The ideal candidate has a PhD in Computer Science, possesses good English speaking and writing skills, and has research interests backed up by a strong publication record in the following areas:

 

- reverse engineering
- program comprehension
- software visualization
- software quality assurance
- meta-modeling
- software evolution

The project is being carried out in the context of the Moose reengineering environment, and applicants are expected to produce tools as support for their research. Moose being mostly developed in Smalltalk, strong knowledge of Smalltalk is a plus.

 

The postdoc position is funded by the Hasler Foundation, Switzerland and will run for 13 months (Sept 1, 2008 - Sept 30 2009):
