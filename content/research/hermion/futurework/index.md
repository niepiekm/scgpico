This page describes ideas that we want to add in the future. If you want to propose a new idea, please send an email to [roethlis@iam.unibe.ch](roethlis@iam.unibe.ch).


-  Bring Smart Group and Package Browser together, drop stand-alone multiple selection browser (as it is integrated in the Smart Group Browser)
-  Package view should only be available in images where Monticello is installed, otherwise the class category view should be used
-  Integrate a tree view in columns
-  Better key bindings
-  Enhance visualizations
