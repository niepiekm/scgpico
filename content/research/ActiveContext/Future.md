#Future

-  Statically typed active context
-  Relation type for active context
-  Object with shared state
-  ![DCI ?](http://www.jroller.com/rickard/entry/contexts_are_the_new_objects) 
-  Distributed active context


-  Error handling, fallback, failed update
-  Garbage collection, sustained system
-  Optimization, e.g. home context, timestamp
-  Problem of identity and state with complex transformation
-  Full reflective model, that is, how to reflect on context themselves
