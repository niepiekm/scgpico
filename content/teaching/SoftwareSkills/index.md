#Description
This 5 ECTS course is a common teaching unit of the three BeNeFri universities which ensures that students have a basic level of programming skills when starting their Master's studies. The course lasts one semester and takes place every week. It comprises three themes:

-  (i) Data structures and representation,
-  (ii) Algorithms and complexity, and
-  (iii) Data analysis.

Each theme is taught in a different university. Each session in a theme revolves around a particular problem and builds on top of the previous sessions. Students should complete exercises of a previous session before a new one starts. 

#Registration
Students should register in the student administration system of their home university according to the rules at the bachelor's level. At the University of Bern, please register in KSL.
