#ArgoUML dilemma continued
The boss of Make Money Inc. decided to go for using ArgoUML as basis for the future visualization engine.

He comes to your team and he asks for a report and a presentation that addresses the followings:

-  What is to be done?
-  Is there a reengineering effort needed upfront? If yes, where and why?
-  What is the rough sketch of the implementation (e.g., which classes will be implemented, where)?
-  What can be discarded from the current ArgoUML?
-  How long will it take to implement the visualizations presented?

He particularly emphasizes that he wants the conclusions to be backed up by data (e.g., visualizations, metrics).

He expects the files containing the report and the presentation by December 5, 24:00h.
