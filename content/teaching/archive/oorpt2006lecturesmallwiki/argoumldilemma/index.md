#ArgoUML dilemma
You are an employee of Make Money Inc.

The boss of the company has recently visited a conference, and he decided he wants the company to build a visualization editor. The visualization editor should support pictures as found in the following articles:

-  [Polymetric Views -- A Lightweight Visual Approach to Reverse Engineering](%assets_url%/scgbib/?query=Lanz03d&filter=Year)
-  [The Class Blueprint: Visually Supporting the Understanding of Classes](%assets_url%/scgbib/?query=Duca05b&filter=Year)
-  [How Developers Drive Software Evolution](%assets_url%/scgbib/?query=Girb05c&filter=Year)
-  [Distribution Map](%assets_url%/scgbib/?query=Duca06c&filter=Year)
-  [How Developers Copy](%assets_url%/scgbib/?query=Bali06a&filter=Year)
-  [Mondrian: An Agile Visualization Framework](%assets_url%/scgbib/?query=Meye06a&filter=Year)

At the conference, he also saw an open source presentation where he saw a presentation of [ArgoUML](http://argouml.tigris.org/), he thinks it might be a good idea to use ArgoUML as an infrastructure for the new endeavor.

But, he is not a stupid boss, and he knows that he should ask his engineers before he takes a decision.

On November 1, 10:15h he comes to you and your team and asks you to answer the following question: <b>Is ArgoUML a good infrastructure for the visualization editor?</b>

He asks you to send a presentation by email until November 7, 24:00h. He suggests several sub-questions:

-  Can we rely on the ArgoUML code?
-  What are the pros and what are the cons?
-  What are the risks?
