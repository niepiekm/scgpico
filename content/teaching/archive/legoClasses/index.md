Title: Lego STEM Classes

#Lego STEM Classes
We love programming. [Jan](%base_url%/staff/kursjan) started programming when he was 12, [Mircea](%base_url%/staff/mircea) started when he was 15. And we kept doing it since then. 
We were lucky to have others help us start and we are paying forward. 

This is why we have decided to teach a course on how to program Lego-based intelligent robots. We have a lego EV3 Educational set and we teach anything that interests our students and is somehow connected to STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics). And it is fun, for us and for our students as well.

In a near future, we would like to extend our activities to have a class participating in [First Lego League (FLL)](http://www.firstlegoleague.org/) competition.

#Join Us
Anyone can join our course. Either as an assistent or a student. If you are interested, contact us ([Jan](%base_url%/staff/kursjan), [Mircea](%base_url%/staff/mircea)) and we can discuss.
