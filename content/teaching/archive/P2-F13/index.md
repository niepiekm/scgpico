This course provides an introduction to object-oriented design, with emphasis on the following themes:
How does Responsibility-Driven Design help you to decompose a complex system into objects?
How does Design by Contract help you to develop robust software?
How do you make use of inheritance to design flexible and generic software systems?
How do iterative and incremental development and continuous refactoring help you to arrive at a clean and understandable design?
How do you effectively test software?
How do you avoid developing complex and unmaintainable code by consistently applying simple design principles?
What kinds of known design patterns help you to simplify your software?
How do you develop software that communicates its own design?
How do you effectively use tools like debuggers, version control systems, and integrated development environments?
