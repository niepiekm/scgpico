Tasks during the Lab


-  One main architectural view of the system (not too much detail, but not too little either. focus on a decent layout)
-  One or more complementary views that describe different perspectives on the system that you could not capture in the main architectural view
-  Detect at least a design problem in the system (e.g. dependency going the wrong direction)
