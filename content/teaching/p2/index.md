#Description
![mvc.png](%assets_url%/files/28/u5z3f26hdoajsvf5tfzwyvq73yzt92/mvc.png)
This course provides an introduction to object-oriented design in Java with an emphasis on practical techniques for developing complex software systems.

#Learning outcomes
You will learn:

-  how to apply *Responsibility-Driven Design* to decompose a complex system into objects
-  how to use *Design by Contract* to develop robust software
-  how to make use of *inheritance* to design flexible and generic software systems
-  how to apply *iterative* and *incremental* development and continuous refactoring to arrive at a clean and understandable design
-  how to effectively *test* software
-  how to develop maintainable code by consistently applying *simple design principles*
-  how to apply *design patterns* to simplify your software
-  how to develop software that *communicates* its own design
-  how to effectively use *development tools* like debuggers, version control systems, and integrated development environments?
