#Description

This course is intended for Bachelors students in the third semester studying a major or minor in Computer Science.
The goal of this course is to provide an introduction to the key concepts of Software Engineering.

#Learning Outcomes

The course will focus on the use of agile software processes, object-oriented methods, UML and other industrial best practices to successful completion of software projects. The following themes will be explored:

-  How can you effectively determine and agree on what a customers really needs?
-  How can you ensure that the software product being developed will satisfy non-functional requirements, such as user-friendliness, robustness,reliability and extensibility?
-  How do you plan a software project and manage a project developed in a team?
-  What tools are available to help support you in a software project?

The exercises for the course will consist of a small software project to be developed by the students in teams over the course of the semester.


#Logistics

This course will be held as combination of “flipped classroom” lectures, and invited guest lectures.

The regular lectures will be made available as hour-long podcasts, with annotated slides available as PDFs. In addition there will be a weekly discussion session lasting 30 minutes to discuss the lecture material, carry out quizzes, and view live demos, followed by an exercise hour. Note that you are expected to study the lecture material in advance of the weekly discussion session. The guest lectures will generally be held live.

The weekly discussion and guest lectures will be held in presence in the classroom (conditions permitting), but students will also be able to join remotely by Zoom. Details will be announced in the Ilias Forum.
