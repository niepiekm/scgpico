#Summary
This course will provide students with an introduction to modern compiler construction. The first two-thirds of the course will cover fundamental topics, and will be based on the text book [Modern Compiler Implementation in Java (Second edition)](http://www.cambridge.org/us/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=9780521820608&ss=res), Cambridge University Press, New York, NY, USA, 2002, by Andrew W. Appel, with Jens Palsberg).  The remaining third of the course covers advanced topics of current interest.

#Learning Outcomes
On successful completion of this course, you will be able to:

-  Distinguish formal and practical properties of different approaches to parsing
-  Understand and implement various techniques to parse source code
-  Implement a basic compiler
-  Use visitors to process an abstract syntax tree (AST)
-  Transform an AST to intermediate representation (IR)
-  Perform peephole optimization on the IR
-  Generate target code (eg Java bytecode) from IR

#Grading
The final grade will be based 10% on exercises, 30% on a team project and 60% on the final exam.
