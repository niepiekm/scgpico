I was a Ph.D. student at SCG between 2018-2022. 
My work essentially involved building tools and methodology to engage several stakeholders in requirements engineering and domain modeling activities.

Currently, I work as ![a research associate](https://www.fhnw.ch/en/about-fhnw/schools/school-of-engineering/institutes/institute-for-interactive-technologies/about-us) at FHNW, Windisch, Switzerland.
