#Vision-Backlog
Vision Backlog is a mobile tablet solution for the modern day requirements engineering needs. Our main focus is Industry 4.0 landscape where many companies will undergo a digital transformation, and building software for numerous aspects of everyday work of the workers would demand a rigorous understanding of the problem domain and an innovative approach to gather and manage requirements.

We encourage and empower project stakeholders to perform requirements engineering activities on their own, possibly at their workspace, and the mobile app does the heavy lifting for requirements engineer/analyst. Vision backlog helps stakeholders to gracefully specify their goals, required contextual information around it. For analysts, it provides several important features such as requirements evolution graphical statistics, a complete overview of the product vision, ability to prepare data for subsequent software modeling activities to name a few.
