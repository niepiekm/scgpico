I'm a PhD candidate at the [Software Composition Group](%base_url%/), University of Bern since October 2008.

At the moment I'm working on an extension of [Moose](http://moose.unibe.ch) called [Moose JEE](http://scg.unibe.ch/research/Moose-JEE). The purpose of this extension is to provide a set of analyses on Java Enterprise Applications.

My research interests are reverse engineering and pattern detection. I am also interested in software quality control.
