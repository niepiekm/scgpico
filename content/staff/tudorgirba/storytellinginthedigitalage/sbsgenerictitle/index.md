Title: SBS Generic title
---

We use titles to summarize the content. When the title is too generic (for example, "Motivation"), it does not transmit content, and thus it is useless.

Oftentimes a generic title tends to transform into [SBS Ever lasting title](%base_url%/staff/tudorgirba/storytellinginthedigitalage/sbseverlastingtitle), that is a title spread over multiple slides.

Use [SR Introduce active title](%base_url%/staff/tudorgirba/storytellinginthedigitalage/srintroduceactivetitle)
