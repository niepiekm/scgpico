Gathering feedback during the presentation is important. One of my rules of thumb is: the success of a presentation is inverse proportional with the number of bits transfered over the network. What if we would show a counter of how many bits are there transfered and how it evolves?

What we can governs what we wish. This transforms to what we can easily governs what we wish. PowerPoint governs presentation forms. Let there be a revolution.

A slide that presents a work in short should provide just enough keywords to google the work.

I strongly believe that in the information age, we are bombarded with stimuli of all sorts and as a result, individuality becomes less important. However, every now and then, a chance appear when the entire concentration of an audience is dedicated to YOU.

The premise of this work is that the audience is not 100% concentrated to hearing the presentation, or that it is not 100% adept to perceive every detail the presenter wants to show. For example, a part of the audience does not see very well. As such, one should not use details that are too small, or one will lose that part of the audience.

Oral communication is complex as it is. Synchronizing the oral communication with visuals or other forms of communication is even more complex.
