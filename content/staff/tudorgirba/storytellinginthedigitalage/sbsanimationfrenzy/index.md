Title: SBS Animation frenzy
---

This bad smell is a syamese twin of [SBS Not apparent animations](%base_url%/staff/tudorgirba/storytellinginthedigitalage/sbsnotapparentanimations). It is different because it manifests in different ways: use of funky animations to introduce each slide, use of animations to introduce each line of text. Presentation tools offer lots of nice features, but that does not mean that one should use all of them in each presentation :).

Use [SR Remove animation](%base_url%/staff/tudorgirba/storytellinginthedigitalage/srremoveanimation)
