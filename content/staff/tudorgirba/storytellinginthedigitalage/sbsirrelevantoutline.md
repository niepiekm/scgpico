#SBS Irrelevant outline
Most of the times, a scientific presentation has the following roadmap:

-  introduction / motivation of the work
-  approach description
-  case studies / validation of the approach
-  discussion
-  conclusions / future work

Such a roadmap is so common that everyone actually expects a presentation to be like that. Therefore, starting with a slide that only has the above text on it, without introducing any relevant knowledge is a waste of the audience energy. 

Better without it :). The alternative is to have a slide summarizing in a sentence each of the points above, except for the discussion and conclusions.
