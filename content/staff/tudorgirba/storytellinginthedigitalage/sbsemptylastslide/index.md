Title: SBS Empty last slide
---

Many times, we tend to end the presentation with a slide holding one or two words to thank the audience or/and to ask for questions.

After a presentation, there comes a period of questions and discussions. During this period the last slide is displayed on the screen. As such, the last slide is actually the most important slide of the presentation because it remains the longest on the screen.

Use [SR Merge slides](%base_url%/staff/tudorgirba/storytellinginthedigitalage/srmergeslides) to merge the empty slide with the conclusions slide.
