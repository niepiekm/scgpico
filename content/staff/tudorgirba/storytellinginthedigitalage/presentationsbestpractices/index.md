Title: Presentations Best Practices
---

Do not just tell the audience what you are going to talk about, also tell it why are you going to talk about that.

Go in the open.

Bond with the audience. The audience is your friend.

Believe in your message. And show it.

The talk is not your slides. The talk is your STORY.

Choose one message.

Have a backup plan.
