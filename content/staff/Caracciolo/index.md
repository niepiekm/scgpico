I'm a PhD Student at the Software Composition Group, University of Bern. 
My research field is software architecture (analysis, modeling and testing). 
My PhD thesis deals with techniques that help keeping the architecture aligned with its specification by supporting the enforcement of design rules and non-functional constraints.
