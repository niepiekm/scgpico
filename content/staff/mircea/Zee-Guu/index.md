Title: Zeeguu
---

The goal of Zeeguu1 is to be a ubiquitous profile which monitors and trains a users vocabulary evolution as they are learning a new language. 

As the learner constantly searches for word definitions while reading eBooks and navigating the web, or browsing dictionaries on his mobile phone, Zeeguu learns about queries and estimates their progress in learning the vocabulary of a new language. 

Zeeguu monitors a learner's progress and builds a model of what parts of vocabulary are already mastered and what parts still need to be learned. The data is collected effortlessly from the user through a series of applications, browser plugins, and dictionaries which use the Zeeguu API. 

Based on the Zeeguu model the user can be presented with progress estimates, reminders, and generated exercises.
