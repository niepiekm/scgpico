##Software Ecosystems
My PhD thesis has focused on software ecosystem analysis and more precisely, on Reverse Engineering Software Ecosystems. In my thesis I argue that reverse engineering which is traditionally performed on individual software systems should raise to the next higher abstraction level: the level of the software ecosystem. I show that by doing this one can better understand individual systems, as well as the entire ecosystem itself. 

In the tool support that I have built for the thesis, I integrate traditional single-system reverse engineering techniques with ecosystem reverse engineering.
One of the research prototypes that I have built during my PhD is 
[The Small Project Observatory](%base_url%/research/SPO) a framework for visualizing the structure and evolution an entire software ecosystem. 

##Architecture Recovery
My interests are broader than ecosystem analysis and they span information visualization, reverse engineering, programming languages, and programming environments. One of the first software analysis tools I have built was [Softwarenaut](/softwarenaut) is a tool which supports the recovery of the architecture of a given software system in an interactive, exploratory way.
