Title: Visualizing Architectural Deltas
---

Note: This proposal is still in a draft phase.

Your goal is to provide a live view on the architecture of a software system. You will have to add new (cool) functionality to the Softwarenaut architecture recovery too.

Several of the challenges that you will have to address are:

-  Find out what are the questions that developers need to ask the most when they visualize the evolution of architecture of a system
-  Discover the best way of highlighting on an architectural view the changes that happened since the given view was created
-  Find the best way of aggregating the changes over a given period of time
-  Implement an awesome UI
-  Deploy the tool to a test team (you'll get help with this one)
