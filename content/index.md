The Software Composition Group carried out research at the borderline between software engineering and programming languages from 1994 to 2021.
The SCG was led by [Oscar Nierstrasz](%base_url%/staff/oscar) at the Institute of Computer Science ([INF](http://www.inf.unibe.ch/index_eng.html)) at the [University of Berne](http://www.unibe.ch/).

As of January 2022, the research and teaching activities of the SCG have been taken over by the [Software Engineering Group](https://seg.inf.unibe.ch) led by [Prof. Timo Kehrer](https://seg.inf.unibe.ch/people/timo/).
